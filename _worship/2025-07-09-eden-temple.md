# Creation as the First Cosmic Mountain

Before God orders the cosmos, the land is described as *tohu va-vohu*, a choatic
wasteland[^1].

This chaotic wasteland is paired with "darkness" and "the deep". The Hebrew word
translated "the deep" is *tehom*. Tehom is treated like a proper name, never
having “the” before it. Even though we have something like “darkness was over
the face of the deep,” literally, it’s “darkness was over the face of Deep
(Tehom.)” Furthermore, it’s treated as a feminine noun elsewhere. (The next time
it’s used is in the flood story and is described as “the great deep,” where
“great” is feminine (rabbah). With the feminine ending, the word would be
Tehomat, which corresponds to Tiamat, the name of the Mesopotamian goddess of
the primeval sea, and she’s described as a sea serpent. In the Babylonian
creation myth, Enuma Elish, tells the story of Marduk, the prime Babylonian
deity, defeating Tiamat and creating the cosmos with her body. While the
prophets utilize myths of God defeating rebellious sea monsters (Isa 51:9-10),
there is no battle here, which would likely have been conspicuous to the
original audience. [^2]


In beginning, Elohim created the sky and the land
    And the land was wild and waste
    And darkness was over the face of Deep
And the spirit of Elohim was hovering over the face of the waters
