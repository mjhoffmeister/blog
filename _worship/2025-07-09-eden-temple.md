# Creation as the First Cosmic Mountain

Before God orders the cosmos, the land is described as *tohu va-vohu*, a choatic
wasteland[^1]

wasteland" is his translation of *tohu va-vohu* and references Everett Fox's
"wild and waste" (*Five Books of Moses*, 13) and Robert Alter's "welter and
waste" (*Five Books of Moses*, 17). See also Wenham, *Genesis 1-15*, 1, "total
chaos".
