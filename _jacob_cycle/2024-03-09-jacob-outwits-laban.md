**The Jacob Cycle - Part 9**

Jacob has worked 14 years as the bride-price for Leah and Rachel. After the birth of a son from his
favored wife, Rachel, he's ready to return home. Laban, thriving because of Yahweh's blessing, 
doesn't want him to leave. God will use the situation to reverse the reversal of Jacob's deception
in Canaan.

## Structure

This episode is divided into two scenes.[^1]

1. Wage negotiations between Jacob and Laban - Genesis 30:25-36
2. Jacob breeds his own flock - Genesis 30:37-31:1 

Now that the story has progressed passed the middle point of the birth of Jacob's children in Haran,
subsequent episodes will refer to, inform, and be informed by their parallel parts that came before.
This story is a reversal of Laban outwitting Jacob in
[Genesis 29:15-30](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/29/15-30).

## Wage negotiations

### Jacob demands to leave

> <sup>25</sup> As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may
go to my own home and country. <sup>26</sup> Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served
you, that I may go, for you know the service that I have given you.”
>
> --Genesis 30:25-26 (ESV)

Jacob demands to leave with his family to return to his "place" (translated "home") and "land"
(translated "country") recalling his experience at Bethel, the "place" where God appeared to him and
promised to return him to and give him the "land" of Cannan
([Genesis 28:13-15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/13-15).) God has fulfilled the promise
to give him children ([Genesis 28:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/14)) and Jacob has
fulfilled his father's commission to find a wife from Laban's household 
([Genesis 28:2](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/2).) Jacob declares that, literally, "the
service I have served you" for the bride-price has been given. This is echoed by Egypt's response to
Israel's fruitfulness in [Exodus 1:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/exodus/1/14), "All their service
they served in violence."

Once again, Jacob insists with an imperative verb and offers no "please," similar to him compelling
Esau to sell him the birthright ([Genesis 25:31](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/31)) and
asserting that Laban give him Rachel after his first seven years of service
([Genesis 29:21](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/29/21); see
[Part 7](jacob-outwits-laban.html#masquerade).) However, whereas Jacob experienced a reversal of his 
purchase of the birthright through Laban masquerading Leah as Rachel, Laban will now experience a
reversal of his deception by God transferring Laban's strong livestock to Jacob.

### Laban asks Jacob to stay

> <sup>27</sup> But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your sight, I have learned by
divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you. <sup>28</sup> Name your wages, and I will
give it.”
>
> --Genesis 30:27-28 (ESV)

Laban is reluctant to let them go, as he was reluctant to let Rebekah go
in [Genesis 24:55](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/24/55) when Abraham's servant asked to leave
with Rebekah after he had been given gifts as the 
bride-price for her. Egypt, too, was unwilling to let Israel go.[^2]

#### Divination

Laban says he learned through divination that Yahweh has blessed him because of Jacob. This 
statement is rich with wordplay. "Divination," *nakhashti*, shares the same root, *nkhsh*, as
"serpent", *nakhash*, in Genesis 3. There, Eve claimed that the serpent deceived her into eating the
fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In the Joseph story in
[Genesis 44:1-17](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/44/1-17), Joseph uses his cup that he claims
to use for divination (*nakhesh*, root *nkhsh*) in a deception to try to get his full-blood brother,
Benjamin, to come to him in Egypt, ostensibly as his "servant" (root *‘vd*,) a keyword in the Jacob
Cycle. Laban is being associated with the seed of the serpent, a deceiver and subjugator. However, 
as Jacob the deceiver was deceived by Laban, Laban will now be deceived by Jacob. God will rescue 
his chosen one from the seed of the serpent, even though Jacob has acted like a seed of the serpent,
himself.

As noted in [Part 3](isaac-and-the-philistines.html#isaac-and-abimelek-make-peace), Genesis has 
established an ideal picture of the nations being blessed by God's chosen and making peace with 
them. While Laban acknowledges Yahweh's blessing, he'll initially follow the way of Pharaoh in
Exodus and try to keep God's chosen from returning to the land of Canaan. The root of the word
"because of you," *big<sup>e</sup>lale*, a rare word in Genesis, is *gll*, the same root for
*yagel*, "rolled away," used in [Genesis 29:10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/29/10) to
describe Jacob single-handedly rolling away the great stone from the well's mouth.[^3] That stone
recalled Bethel (see [Part 6](jacob-arrives-at-labans-house.html#jacob-meets-rachel),) demonstrating
that God had indeed come with Jacob to Haran, giving him strength to roll away a stone alone that at
least three shepherds couldn't move together. *gll* is also the root for *gullulim*, idols, which
are associated with "household gods", *teraphim*, in
[2 Kings 23:24](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2-kings/23/24).[^4] Later, we'll learn of Laban's
household gods. This suggests that it was by way of his gods that he practiced divination. However,
Yahweh is the god of gods. Any information that Laban divined was ultimately given by Yahweh, and
the Jacob story will later portray the defeat of Laban's household gods
([Genesis 31:34-35](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/31/34-35).) The exodus is framed similarly,
with the plagues demonstrating Yahweh's power over Egyptian gods.[^5] After the Israelites cross 
the Sea of Reeds, Moses and Israel sang a song about God's victory over the gods of Egypt.

> <sup>11</sup> “Who is like you, O LORD, among the gods?  
<sup>&ensp;&ensp;</sup>&ensp;&ensp; Who is like you, majestic in holiness,  
<sup>&ensp;&ensp;</sup>&ensp;&ensp; awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?  
<sup>11</sup> You stretched out your right hand;  
<sup>&ensp;&ensp;</sup>&ensp;&ensp; the earth swallowed them.
>
> --Exodus 15:11-12 (ESV)

#### Laban's oracle

While Laban doesn't outright deny Jacob's request to leave, he tries to entice Jacob to stay by
offering him wages so that he can continue to profit from Yahweh's blessing. He literally says "mark
your wages." "Mark" is another rare word in the Bible. Its root is *nqv*, which is related to the 
root *qvv*, which means "to curse." The two roots are linked in Leviticus 24:11.

> <sup>10</sup> Now an Israelite woman’s son, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the
people of Israel. And the Israelite woman’s son and a man of Israel fought in the camp,
<sup>11</sup> and the Israelite woman’s son blasphemed [*yiqqov*, root *nqv*] the Name, and cursed
[*y<sup>e</sup>allel*, root *qll*].
>
> --Leviticus 24:10-11b (ESV)

God's promise that he would bless those who bless his chosen ones and curse those who curse them is
subtly recalled here.[^6] The fact that Laban is the one to reiterate the promise of blessing and 
curse is ironic and further demonstrates that God is in control, fulfilling his promises, even if
his actions aren't obvious. He'll work through both deceivers, Jacob and Laban, to accomplish his
plan.

Laban, nonetheless, unaware that he's uttering a kind of oracle, seeks to permanently keep Jacob in
his service. [Part 7](laban-outwits-jacob.html#from-nephew-to-servant) explained that "wages" are
used to ensure Jacob's subservience. The root for "mark," *nqv*, has another meaning, "pierce,"
"bore." A verb with the exact same meaning is *ratsa‘* which appears in a covenant law about a slave
wishing to stay with his master. That law echoes Jacob's situation.

> <sup>2</sup> When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go
out free, for nothing. <sup>4</sup> If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or
daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out alone. <sup>5</sup>
But if the slave plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’
<sup>6</sup> then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the
doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.
>
> --Exodus 21:2, 4-6 (ESV)

While this law comes after Jacob's time, the references to seven years of service, an unmarried
servant being given a wife who bears him sons or daughters, and the provision for perpetual 
servitude through "piercing" the servant's ear suggest that the law is deliberately connected to 
Jacob's story. Later, Laban will assert that his daughters and their children belong to him 
([Genesis 31:43](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/31/43),) further strengthening the link.[^7]

Despite Laban's apparent dominion over Jacob, God will set him free.

### Jacob emphasizes Yahweh's blessing

> <sup>29</sup> Jacob said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock
has fared with me. <sup>30</sup> For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly,
and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household
also?”
>
> --Genesis 30:29-30 (ESV)

Jacob underscores his role in Laban's success: it's only by the blessing of Yahweh that accompanied
him that Laban has prospered. The root for the word translated "increased" is *prts*, "break out,"
the same root for the verb used in God's promise to Jacob at Bethel that his offspring would "spread
abroad" (*paratsta*, root *prts*) to the four corners of the earth and that all the families of the
earth would be blessed through his descendants
([Genesis 28:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/14).) Though Jacob is perhaps attempting to
persuade Laban to send him away with a gift
(see [Deuteronomy 15:12-15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/deuteronomy/15/12-15) which could also have
echoes of Jacob's situation,) he's expressing a sad truth: his grasping, scheming, and deception 
have led to the blessing God intended to give to him freely going to Laban.

### Wage negotiations

> <sup>31</sup> He said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If
you will do this for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it: <sup>32</sup> let me pass
through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black
lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they shall be my wages. <sup>33</sup> So my
honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is
not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be
counted stolen.” <sup>34</sup> Laban said, “Good! Let it be as you have said.” <sup>35</sup> But
that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that
were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put
them in the charge of his sons. <sup>36</sup> And he set a distance of three days’ journey between
himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban’s flock.
>
> --Genesis 30:31-36

Laban, perhaps refusing to send Jacob away with a gift in line with the law later outlined in
Deuteronomy, asks again what he can give Jacob.[^8] Jacob responds with a proposal that Laban likely
couldn't refuse. Most sheep are white, and most goats are either black or dark brown.[^9] Since
Jacob insists that Laban give him nothing, he probably suggests that the spotted animals be
separated and marked as Laban's property. From that point on, any spotted or speckled animals born
to the solid-colored flock that Jacob would manage would belong to him. Although Jacob offers to
separate the animals himself, the cunning Laban chooses to do it personally and creates a
significant distance between Jacob and the marked animals, further reducing the likelihood that the
flock Jacob cared for would produce animals for him.[^10]

## Jacob breeds his flock

> <sup>37</sup> Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white
streaks in them, exposing the white of the sticks. <sup>38</sup> He set the sticks that he had
peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to
drink. And since they bred when they came to drink, <sup>39</sup> the flocks bred in front of the
sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted. <sup>40</sup> And Jacob
separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the
flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban’s flock.
<sup>41</sup> Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the
troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks, <sup>42</sup> but for
the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban’s, and the
stronger Jacob’s. <sup>43</sup> Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks, female servants
and male servants, and camels and donkeys. <sup>31:1</sup> Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban
were saying, “Jacob has taken all that was our father’s, and from what was our father’s he has
gained all this wealth.”
>
> --Genesis 30:37-31:1

At this point, the story begins to unwind. Jacob served as a conduit of God's blessing to Laban, and
now God will return the blessing to Jacob. The details of Jacob's breeding program are difficult to 
follow, but, before addressing them, the more important literary elements that demonstrate a
reversal of Jacob's situation will be discussed.

### Reversal

The reversals of Jacob's scheming and deceptions that he's experienced in Haran are now themselves
being reversed. Jacob bought Esau's birthright, also called Edom because it sounds like "red,"
*adom* with red stew ([Genesis 25:30](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/30).) This was echoed
in Leah later buying time to sleep with Jacob as her "wage" in exchange for Reuben's mandrakes
([Genesis 30:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/30/16).) Jacob completes the reversal by
obtaining the wages he wants from Laban, whose name means "white" (*lavan*.) He obtains strong
animals using white sticks to influence their breeding.[^11]

Food and drink were involved in Jacob's dealings with Esau and Isaac. They both ate and drank
(*yest*, root *sth*; [Genesis 25:35](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/35),
[Genesis 27:25](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/25)) as they were being manipulated by
Jacob. This was reversed through the "drinking feast" (*mishteh*, root *sth*) that Laban hosted for
Jacob's sham wedding ([Genesis 29:22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/29/22).) It was reversed
again through Jacob's selective breeding where the animals came to "drink" *sh<sup>e</sup>toth*
(root *shth*.)[^12]

Jacob's masqueraded as Esau by wearing goat skins to trick the "dim-eyed" Isaac into blessing him
([Genesis 27:1-29](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/1-29).) Laban masqueraded the "weak-eyed"
Leah, "wild cow," as Rachel, "ewe lamb" to make a servant out of Jacob and receive blessing through
him ([Genesis 29:23](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/29/23),
[Genesis 30:27](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/30/27).) As will be shown below, Jacob uses
fake animals to give Laban a weak flock and receive the strong lambs and goats he wants.[^13]

| Event | Reversal | Reversal reversed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jacob buys the birthright from Edom, "red", with red stew | Leah buys Jacob as her "wage" for Reuben's mandrakes | Jacob gets the "wages" he wants from Laban, "white," using white sticks |
| Jacob gives Esau and Isaac food and drink; they ate and "drank" | Laban hosts a "drinking feast" for Jacob's wedding | Jacob breeds flocks where they came to "drink" |
| Jacob deceives his "dim-eyed" father wearing goat skins | Laban deceives Jacob with his "weak-eyed" daughter, Leah, "wild cow," acting as Rachel, "ewe lamb" | Jacob deceives Laban, giving him a "weak" flock and attaining strong "lambs" for himself |

### Jacob's breeding program

There are several ways that Jacob's breeding program could be interpreted. A popular one is that 
Jacob uses folk breeding practices or even attempts magic to effect the birth of more spotted
animals, meaning Jacob believed that when the flocks mated, their young would look like whatever
they could see.[^14] An issue with that explanation is that it doesn't explain why Jacob would put
the stronger animals of Laban's flock in front of the branches in
[Genesis 30:40-41](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/30/40-41), as that would result in
the strengthening of Laban's flock.[^15] An alternative view is that "in front of" can be translated
"on." It's been observed even today that animals in heat sometimes "mate" with trees or sticks. So,
Jacob could have set up the branches to effectively masquerade as animals and draw away those of the
flock he didn't want to breed. This would allow him to selectively breed a strong flock for himself
and a weak one for Laban. Regarding the sheep, while those he didn't want bearing young were
distracted by the sticks, he arranged those he did want to breed in a position more advantageous to
breeding, not "face to face."[^16]

Regardless of the technicalities, the narrative links to what has come before demonstrate the 
scheming and deceptions that revisited Jacob through Laban are now being revisited on Laban through
Jacob.

### The blessing returns to Jacob

The narrator states that Jacob "increased greatly," which links back to Jacob stating that Laban
had "increased abundantly" in [Genesis 30:30](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/30/30), itself
linking back to God's promise that Jacob's offspring would "spread/increase" (see 
[above](#jacob-emphasizes-yahwehs-blessing).) Jacob's increases, literally, "very, very"
(*m<sup>e</sup>’od m<sup>e</sup>’od*.) Whatever increase Laban experienced, Jacob experiences twice
as much.[^17]

The reference to the possessions Jacob attains echoes the wealth Abram gained in Egypt.

> <sup>16</sup> And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys,
male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
>
> --Genesis 12:16 (ESV)

While Yahweh isn't mentioned in the abundance Jacob experiences or the diminishing that Laban
suffers, the narrative is hinting at who is truly responsible for it, even if Jacob is unaware.

The episode ends on a foreboding note. The common theme of sibling rivalry and jealousy is repeated
as Laban's sons see what Jacob has and considers it theft.
