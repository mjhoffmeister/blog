**The Jacob Cycle - Part 9**

At least 14 years, two periods of working for seven years as the bride-prices for Lean and Rachel, must have passed, because Jacob formally asks Laban to return home.  With the birth of a child from his favorite wife, Jacob is ready to return home, perhaps feeling that he had fulfilled his father’s commission to find a wife from Laban’s household (Genesis 28:2) and that God had fulfilled his promise to give him offspring (Genesis 28:14.) 

Negotiations
Genesis 30:25-36

Jacob requests to leave with his family to return to his “place” and “'land,” recalling his experience at Bethel. He says he has fulfilled his commitment to Laban with “the service I have served you.” This is echoed by Egypt’s response to Israel’s fruitfulness in Exodus 1:14: “All their service they served in violence.” Laban is reluctant to let them go, as he was reluctant to let Rebekah go in Genesis 24:55 (this was after he had been given gifts.) Egypt, too, was unwilling to let Israel go (Wenham: 260).

Laban says he learned through divination that Yahweh has blessed him because of Jacob. Some commentators are reluctant to say that Laban actually used divination (Sarna: 211, Wenham: ?), however, we later learn that Laban serves other gods, as Rachel steals them before Jacob and his family flee (Genesis 31:30.) Furthermore, the root for “divination,” nhs, is the same root for nahash, “snake/serpent” in Genesis 3. The narrator could be associating Laban with the seed of the serpent.

Regardless, what is certain is that we’re receiving further confirmation that God has kept his promise. He has gone with Jacob into foreign territory and begun the work of making Jacob’s descendants like “the dust of the earth” and blessing all the “families of the earth through him” (Genesis 28:14).

While Laban doesn’t outright deny Jacob’s request to leave, he tries to entice Jacob to stay by offering him wages. He could let Jacob leave with nothing besides his family, but he wants him to stay because of Yahweh’s blessing that has come with him. Jacob essentially says “If God has done so much for you as the result of the work, surely you can now do something for me or let me do something for my family.” Jacob’s response links back to 28:14 with the word “increased” (Wenham: 255).

Laban again (politely) asks what he can give Jacob. Jacob responds with an offer that Laban probably couldn’t refuse. Most sheep are white and most goats are all black or dark brown (Ibid.) While it’s not perfectly clear, because Jacob said that Laban will give him nothing, he mostly likely suggests that the spotted animals be separated and marked as Laban’s. After that point, any spotted animal born would be Jacob’s. Laban decides to separate the animals most likely to have children that would go to Jacob to reduce the chances of them being born (Walton: 589.)

Jacob breeds his flock
Genesis 30:37-31:1

At this point, the story begins to unwind. The blessing flowed out from God with Jacob as a conduit to Laban, and now God will return the blessing to Jacob as he leaves with him back into Yahweh’s land.

There are several ways that this section could be interpreted. One is that Jacob uses folk breeding practices or even attempts magic to effect the birth of more spotted animals. The idea here would be that when the flocks mated, their young would look like whatever they could see. The main problem with this is that it doesn’t explain why Jacob would put the stronger animals of Laban’s flock in front of the branches in Genesis 30:40-41 (Noegel: 9). An alternative view is that “in front of” can be translated “on.” It’s been observed even today that animals in heat sometimes “interact” with trees or sticks. So, Jacob could have set up the branches to draw away the animals he didn’t want to breed and selectively build a strong flock that would belong to him. Regarding the sheep, while those he didn’t want bearing young were distracted by the sticks, he arranged those he did want to breed in a position more advantageous to breeding, not “face to face.” (Ibid. 12-13.)

Regardless of the technicalities, the elaborate story about Jacob breeding his own strong flock and diminishing Laban’s provides opportunity to link back to Laban’s deception with Leah and the episode about the mandrakes. In Genesis 29, Laban tricks Jacob into marrying Leah, “wild cow,” instead of Rachel “ewe lamb.” Here, Jacob tricks Laban into giving him lambs he wanted. Laban’s deception was after a “drinking feast” (mishteh,) and Jacob tricked Laban out of the best flock where the animals came “to drink” (shetoth). The mandrakes are meant to be an aphrodisiac or fertility drug used by Rachel, but it’s Leah who conceives. The branches are used against Laban’s flock to give Jacob a large, strong flock (Ibid. 14).

Genesis 30:43 shows God had fulfilled his promise to Jacob in Gen 28:14 (“spread” and “increased” are the same word in Hebrew.) It also echoes Abraham being blessed in Egypt Genesis 12:16.
