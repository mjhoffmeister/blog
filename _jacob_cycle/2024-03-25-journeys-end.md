**The Jacob Cycle - Part 12**

The final scenes of the Jacob Cycle have numerous references to what has come before. The Abraham
and Joseph stories end in a similar way, illustrating the intentional design of Genesis and 
reinforcing the idea that the stories of these generations elaborate on one another and are meant 
to be compared to get their full meaning.

## Return to Bethel

### Going up

> <sup>1</sup> God said to Jacob, “**Arise**, **go up** to Bethel and **dwell (stay)** there. Make
an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”
>
> --Genesis 35:1 (ESV) [emphasis added]

> <sup>43</sup> "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. **Arise**, **flee** to Laban my brother in 
Haran <sup>44</sup> and **stay** with him a while, until your brother’s fury turns away—"
>
> --Genesis 27:43-44 (ESV) [emphasis added]

When Rachel commanded Jacob to flee to Haran, she told him to “arise,” “flee,” and “stay.” At the 
end of the Jacob story, God commands Jacob to “arise,” “go up,” and “stay.” Jacob’s flight from the 
land is being reversed[^1].

“Go up” (*‘aleh*,) has the same root word (*‘lh*) as “ascending” (*‘olim*) in 
[Genesis 28:12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/12) where Jacob had the vision of angels 
ascending the stairway between earth and heaven.

> <sup>12</sup> And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of 
it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were **ascending (‘olim)** and descending on it!
>
> --Genesis 28:12 (ESV) [emphasis added]

(*‘aleh*) is connected to pilgrimage elsewhere in the Bible (for example, 
[1 Samuel 1:3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1-samuel/1/3) and 
[Jeremiah 31:6](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/jeremiah/31/6)[^2].) He's returning to the land, to 
the house of God, *beth-el*, and the gate of heaven. God commands him to build an altar, which
reminds us of Jacob’s promise to worship God at the end of the Bethel scene in 
[Genesis 28:21-22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/21-22). Building an altar is a
reaffirmation of his loyalty to Yahweh[^2].

### Foreign gods

> <sup>2</sup> So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign 
gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments. <sup>3</sup> Then let us 
arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day 
of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.” <sup>4</sup> So they gave to Jacob all 
the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the 
terebinth tree that was near Shechem. 
>
> --Genesis 35:2-4 (ESV)

It’s likely that the foreign gods were acquired along with the people and possessions taken from 
the Hivites (see [Genesis 34:29](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/34/20)). Worship of other 
gods is incompatible with loyalty to Yahweh 
([Exodus 20:3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/exodus/20/3),) so idols had to be purged from the 
community. Purification rituals found later in the Bible are often connected to preparing
oneself for encountering God. Changing clothes represents putting off an old way of life and taking 
up a new one. After the slaughter of the Hivite men, Jacob may have recognized the need for 
spiritual renewal before returning to Bethel[^3].

After Jacob confesses that it was God who has protected him throughout, the people turn over their 
idols and earrings. The earrings might have had images or symbols of gods on them[^4]. 
Surprisingly, Jacob doesn’t destroy them. He instead hides them under the terebinth tree at Shechem. 
Abraham set up an altar to Yahweh at this tree when he first entered the land in 
[Genesis 12:6-7](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/12/6-7). It was probably originally a 
site of worship to a god or gods of Canaan. Abraham building an altar there would have been an act of 
spiritual warfare claiming the superiority of Yahweh. Jacob hiding idols by burying them under the 
tree could be just as good as destroying them as a sacred site would likely not be disturbed. 
Rachel’s sitting on Laban’s household gods during her period could perhaps be recalled now to see 
them as being miscarried and hidden under the ground; their demise had begun in 
[Genesis 31:34-35](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/31/34-35)[^5].

### Bethel reaffirmed

> <sup>5</sup> And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, 
so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. <sup>6</sup> And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), 
which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him, <sup>7</sup> and there he 
built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when 
he fled from his brother.
>
> --Genesis 35:5-7 (ESV)

In [Genesis 34:30](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/34/30), it was hinted that Jacob's passive
response to the Dinah/Shechem situation stemmed from fear of the Hivites. His fear is proven 
unfounded. God prevents the Hivites from any vengeful pursuit[^4].

We’re reminded that the place formerly called Luz had been transformed into Bethel, “House of God,” 
by God’s appearance there. He built an altar, fulfilling his promise to God, and updates the name 
to El-Bethel “The God of Bethel,” establishing the continuity that it’s been the same god that’s 
been with Jacob his entire journey[^4].

## The death of Deborah

> <sup>8</sup> And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So 
he called its name Allon-bacuth.
>
> --Genesis 35:8 (ESV)

The recording of Deborah’s death is a puzzle. It could serve as emphasis of the consequences of 
Rebekah’s actions in the deception of Isaac. She hoped to see Jacob again (see
[Genesis 27:45](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/45).)
Instead, she disappears from the story. Not even her death is recorded, although her nurse’s is
[^3]. Deborah's death could also be connected to the burial of the foreign gods. Deborah would have 
come with Rebekah from Haran in Mesopotamia, outside the land. Ties to things other than Yahweh and 
his land are dying and being buried under trees, both gods and humans[^6].

## God appears to Jacob

> <sup>9</sup> God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. 
<sup>10</sup> And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, 
but Israel shall be your name.” So he called his name Israel. <sup>11</sup> And God said to him, 
“I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from 
you, and kings shall come from your own body. <sup>12</sup> The land that I gave to Abraham and 
Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.” <sup>13</sup> Then 
God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him. <sup>14</sup> And Jacob set up a 
pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering 
on it and poured oil on it. <sup>15</sup> So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken 
with him Bethel.
>
> --Genesis 35:9-15 (ESV)

God appears to Jacob again at Bethel and reaffirms and reemphasizes his blessing and promises. God's
words to Jacob are a combination of promises to Abraham, Isaac’s prayer before Jacob left for 
Haran, and the original promises to Jacob at Bethel, showing that since God called Abraham’s family 
out of Haran, he has been faithful and trustworthy[^7]. Jacob comes full circle and 
fulfills his promise he made at Bethel, reaffirming his loyalty to Yahweh.

## The death of Rachel and birth of Benjamin

> <sup>16</sup> Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, 
Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor. <sup>17</sup> And when her labor was at its 
hardest, the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for you have another son.” <sup>18</sup> And as her 
soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him 
Benjamin. <sup>19</sup> So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, 
Bethlehem), <sup>20</sup> and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel’s 
tomb, which is there to this day.
>
> --Genesis 35:16-20 (ESV)

It may seem strange that Jacob moves on from Bethel, but he follows the footsteps of Abraham and 
paves the way for Joshua’s conquest of Canaan. The same paths are taken by all three. Abraham and 
Jacob accomplish an ideal, symbolic conquest before Joshua executes one by way of war[^8].

In [Genesis 30:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/30/1), Rachel demanded children from Jacob, 
exclaiming she would die if she didn’t get what she wanted. After she had Joseph, she expressed no 
gratitude to Yahweh, looking to him only to give her more of what she wanted. Here, we tragically 
see her getting what she wanted and losing her life for it. Her pregnancy is set in contrast to 
Rebekah's in [Genesis 25:22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/22/23). Both pregnancies are 
difficult, but where Rebekah calls on Yahweh, Rachel expresses sorrow by calling her son Ben-Oni, 
“son of sorrow.” Jacob, having another son from his favorite wife, instead names him Benjamin, 
“son of my right hand.” The right-hand side was considered the favored or lucky side[^7]. Jacob 
continues following the pattern of having favorites.

Rachel’s tomb becomes a famous landmark referenced later in the Bible 
([1 Samuel 10:2](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1-samuel/10/2))[^9].

## Reuben’s challenge

> <sup>21</sup> Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder. <sup>21</sup> 
While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine. And Israel 
heard of it. 
>
> --Genesis 35:21-22a (ESV)

Migdal Eder means “herd tower” and was likely a place to protect flocks from raiders[^10]. It's 
south of Ephrath, showing that Jacob is continuing his symbolic conquest of Canaan.

Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob’s unloved wife Leah, sleeps with Bilhah to both prevent her from 
becoming the new favorite and as a challenge to Jacob’s authority. We saw the same with Ham in 
[Genesis 9:22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/9/22) ("saw the nakedness of his father" likely 
means that Ham slept with his mother[^11],) and Absolom will sleep with David’s concubines as a 
challenge to his father’s authority in 
[2 Samuel 16:22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2-samuel/16/22)[^12]. However, by grasping for 
authority, Reuben loses all hope for it. Judah is now implicitly set up to carry on the line of the 
chosen seed of the woman. Reuben, Simeon, and Levi have all disqualified themselves, like Esau did.

## The list of Jacob's sons

> Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.  
> &ensp;<sup>23</sup> The sons of Leah:  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn),  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.  
> &ensp;<sup>24</sup> The sons of Rachel:  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Joseph and Benjamin.  
> &ensp;<sup>25</sup> The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s servant:  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Dan and Naphtali.  
> &ensp;<sup>26</sup> The sons of Zilpah, Leah’s servant:  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Gad and Asher.  
> These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
>
> --Genesis 35:22b-26 (ESV)


Now that Benjamin is born, a full list of his sons can be given. They're grouped by mother and set 
up in a chiasm to emphasize Jacob’s favoritism and the rifts in the family, setting up the Joseph 
story[^12].

## The death of Isaac

> <sup>27</sup> And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), 
where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned. <sup>28</sup> Now the days of Isaac were 180 years. 
<sup>29</sup> And Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full 
of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
>
> --Genesis 35:27-29 (ESV)

Mamre is a significant place in the Bible. It’s associated with names meaning “fatness” and 
“cluster of grapes” ([Genesis 14:13](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/14/13))[^13]. Abraham 
settled there after he and Lot separated and built an alter to Yahweh 
([Genesis 13:18](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/13/18).) God appeared to Abraham there and 
promised that Isaac would be born in a year 
([Genesis 18:1-10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/18/1-10).) It’s an Eden space.

Isaac’s burial echoes Abraham’s in [Genesis 25:7-9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/7-9). 
Isaac and Ishmael came together after being estranged to bury Abraham. Esau and Jacob’s 
reconciliation is reinforced as they bury Isaac together.

The story of Jacob ends with him making peace with his past, but having set up a situation that 
will lead to more conflict in the future.

## Conclusion

What we’ve seen in Jacob’s story is that God desired to bless and protect the chosen seed of the 
woman so that all people of the world could be brought back to God and Eden and take part in that 
blessing. Grasping for that blessing was unnecessary and only delayed what God wanted to give 
freely. Nevertheless, God still worked through the difficult situations caused by human taking. 
His plan to rescue humanity cannot be stopped, not even by those he’s working to rescue.

It also reveals that allegiance to Yahweh doesn’t magically result in becoming perfect. Jacob was 
“baptized” in the Jabbok river after wrestling with God, but his old nature remained; we see it 
in the Joseph story. Nevertheless, the writer of Hebrews commends Jacob’s faith at the end of his 
life in [Hebrews 11:21](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/hebrews/11/21).

If we feel overwhelmed at our sin or lack of perfection, we can know that God can work through it 
and in spite of it and can change us. If we feel frustrated that things aren't working out in our 
efforts for God’s kingdom, we can return to this story and ask “Am I grasping, or am I allowing 
myself to freely receive God’s blessing and let it flow from me?”
