The first part of the Jacob Cycle encompasses 
[Genesis 25:19-34](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/19-34) and is divided into 4 
sections.[^1]

## Introduction

### The *toledot* of Isaac

>  <sup>19</sup> [And] these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham fathered Isaac...
>
> --Genesis 25:19 (ESV)

As discussed in [Part 1](overview.html#these-are-the-generations), the *toledot* (translated 
"generations" in the ESV) of Isaac is part of a larger chain starting with the *toledot* of Shem. 
This chain is concerned with the call of a specific family through whom God will work to rescue 
humanity.

A contrast is seen between the *toledot*s of Isaac and Ishmael.

> <sup>12</sup> [And] these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the 
Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham.
>
> --Genesis 25:12 (ESV)

In the *toledot* of Ishmael, it’s Hagar who bears Ishmael (to Abraham,) while Abraham is said to 
bear/father Isaac. Abraham is distanced from Ishmael. This highlights Isaac as the chosen seed of 
the woman as foretold by God in [Genesis 21:12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/21/12). 
Although Ishmael isn't chosen by God to be the child of promise, he's still blessed in fulfillment 
of God's promise to Abraham in [Genesis 17:20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/17/20).[^3] 
This is important to remember for the Jacob story. Virtually all the characters operate under a 
scarcity mindset: if one person is blessed, that means others lose out. Part of the teaching of the 
Jacob Cycle is that God's ability to bless isn't constrained by human institutions or expectations.

### Isaac's age

> <sup>20</sup> and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah...
>
> --Genesis 25:20a (ESV)

Isaac is said to be 40 when he married Rebekah. Numbers are used symbolically in the Bible. One can 
believe they’re literal or purely figurative (or not know) and still learn what the Bible is 
teaching through them.

That Genesis interacts with Mesopotamian (Sumerian, Babylonian, etc.) writings is undeniable 
(*Enuma Elish* and *Atra-Hasis* are notable examples.) This interaction can be viewed, in part, as 
a polemic (critical attack) against Babylon, which was located in southern Mesopotamia. Ages in 
Genesis follow a Mesopotamian model, as well.

The Sumerians and Babylonians used the sexagesimal (base 60) numeral system. A period of 5 years is 
significant in that system because 5 years represents 60 months.[^4] Often, ages reported in 
Genesis are multiples of 5 and additions of the number 7. When ages don’t fit that pattern, it's at 
least sometimes for a narrative purpose.

So, Isaac being forty (5 x 8) when he marries Rebekah perhaps illustrates that this is a 
significant event in the fulfillment of God’s plan to protect the chosen line. (It also establishes 
a comparison with Esau who is 40 when he marries, later.) Abraham being 86 when Ishmael is born in 
[Genesis 16:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/16/16) shows that event was incongruent with 
God’s plan.

### The Arameans of Paddan-aram

> <sup>20</sup> and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the 
Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife.
>
> --Genesis 25:20 (ESV)

In [Genesis 24:10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/24/10), Abraham's servant goes to Haran
(referred to as "the city of Nahor") to find a wife for Isaac. Paddan-aram may be another name for 
Haran.[^5] So, we’re reminded of Isaac’s link with Laban and Haran/Padan-aram (perhaps “field of 
Aram,” see [Hosea 12:12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/hosea/12/12).) Jacob will later flee to 
Haran, meeting his match in trickery and deception in his uncle Laban.

But why are Bethuel and Laban called Arameans here? And why is Haran called Paddan-aram?

The Arameans of the Bible could be the descendants of the Israelites taken into captivity by the 
Assyrians. If that is correct, the Jacob story might have an early echo of the hope of the 
re-integration of the Israelites who were deported to Assyria through Jacob’s later exile from the 
land to the “field of Aram” where “Laban the Aramean” lived. The prophets expressed hope that those 
captured by Assyria would return.[^6]

> <sup>10</sup> In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as a signal for the peoples—of him 
shall the nations inquire, and his resting place shall be glorious. <sup>11</sup> In that day the 
Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant that remains of his people, from 
Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the 
coastlands of the sea.
>
> <sup>16</sup> And there will be a highway from Assyria for the remnant that remains of his 
people, as there was for Israel when they came up from the land of Egypt.
>
> --Isaiah 11:10-11, 16 (ESV)

Abraham could represent Judah, which was exiled to Babylon, providing depth as to why Terah took 
his family from Ur (in Babylon) to Haran.[^7]

Exile is a central theme in the Jacob Cycle. It was suggested in 
[Part 1](introduction.html#historical-context) that the final form of the story as we have it in 
the Bible was arranged in the period of the Babylonian exile. Terminology is being used here that 
might have caused the original hearers or readers to consider the exile of the northern tribes to 
Assyria and of the southern tribes to Judah. The hope of return to the land as established at Bethel 
([Genesis 28:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/15)) would call to them from the past and 
give them hope. If you're a Christian, that hope calls to you, as well, as you endure through the 
final exodus ([Revelation 12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/revelation/12)) and wait for the ultimate 
reunification of heaven and earth 
([Revelation 22:10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/revelation/22/10).)

## Pregnancy and birth of Esau and Jacob

### Rebekah's barrenness

> <sup>21</sup> And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD 
granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
>
> --Genesis 25:21 (ESV)

As shown in [Parallels with the Abraham Cycle](#parallels-with-the-abraham-cycle), Genesis 25:19-34 
closely parallels Genesis 11:27-12:9. The parallel verses to Genesis 25:21 in the Abraham Cycle are 
Genesis 11:29-30.

> <sup>29</sup> And Abram and Nahor took wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of 
Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and Iscah. <sup>30</sup> Now Sarai 
was barren; she had no child.
>
> --Genesis 11:29-30 (ESV)

The barrenness of the matriarchs of the chosen line is a recurring theme that shows that it isn’t 
by human effort that the blessed seed of the woman will continue; it’s by God’s power. In 
the Abraham and Sarah story, it takes 9 chapters to resolve Sarah’s barrenness as they try to 
overcome it their own way. Although we learn that it's 20 years after Isaac and Rebekah marry 
before Esau and Jacob are born, it only takes one verse for Rebekah's barrenness to be resolved 
in the narrative.[^8]

Sarai and Abram (Sarah and Abraham's names before God changes them) try to resolve their fertility 
issues by having a slave woman, Hagar act as a surrogate mother. The Bible makes it clear that this 
was contrary to God's plan by linking it with Eve and Adam eating from the forbidden tree of the 
knowledge of good an evil.

> <sup>6</sup> So when the woman [*ishah*] saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a 
delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took [*tiqqah*] of 
its fruit and ate, and she also gave [*titten*] some to her husband [*ish*] who was with her, and 
he ate.
>
> --Genesis 3:6 (ESV)

> <sup>3</sup> So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife 
[*ishah*], took [*tiqqah*] Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave [*titten*] her to Abram her 
husband [*ish*] as a wife.
>
> --Genesis 16:3 (ESV)

The transliterated Hebrew for shared words between these two verses is given to show how the 
authors of the Bible purposely linked them together. Sarai and Abram taking matters into their own 
hands is linked to the fall story of Genesis 3. In both cases, human wills were out of alignment 
with God's, leading to tragic consequences.

Rather than turn away from God, Isaac and Rebekah turn toward him, hoping that he will resolve their
infertility. 

> <sup>21</sup> And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD 
granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
>
> --Genesis 25:21 (ESV)

The structure of verse 21 in Hebrew illustrates that Isaac's prayer results in God reversing 
Rebekah's situation from barrenness to conception. A literal translation preserving the original 
language word order surfaces this.[^9]

&ensp;&ensp;And prayed (a) Isaac to Yahweh (b)  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;for his wife (c) because barren (d) she was  
&ensp;&ensp;And granted his prayer (a'), Yahweh (b')  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;and conceived (d') Rebekah, his wife (c')

Isaac prays to Yahweh and that prayer is answered by Yahweh. The result is that his wife's 
barrenness is reversed to conception. Even the word order of "wife" and her condition is reversed 
in its parallel line: wife (subject) > barren (condition) becomes conceived (condition) > wife 
(subject).

The root of the Hebrew word translated "prayed" here is *‘tr*. This is the first time a word with 
that root is used in the Bible, occurring 25 times in total. The more common word for “pray” (*pll*)
occurs 172 times, so the usage of *‘tr* here is interesting. The next time it's used, and most 
often, is in Exodus when Moses asks God to remove the plagues[^10]. The Jacob Cycle will often 
allude to Israel's time in Egypt, connecting it to Jacob's exile in Haran. So, we have both an early 
connection to Israel's enslavement in Egypt and Rebekah's barrenness being addressed in the same way
that Moses addresses the plagues on behalf of Pharaoh. Isaac asks God to remove a chaotic, 
"de-creation" state to restore order, though it was God himself who allowed that chaos to manifest 
to reveal himself ([Exodus 7:5](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/exodus/7/5).)

### Crushing in the womb

> <sup>22</sup> The children struggled together within her, and she said, “If it is thus, why is 
this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the LORD.
>
> --Genesis 25:22 (ESV)

The Hebrew word translated “struggled” (*yitrotsatsu*) is an unusual verb which means “smash, 
crush.” It's used figuratively in the Bible to describe the oppression of the poor, and literally 
to describe skulls smashing together or reeds being broken.[^11] This violent term could be an echo 
of God’s statement that he would place enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the 
serpent.[^12] It also foreshadows the hostility between Esau and Jacob and the nations that will 
come from them.[^13]

### Inquiring of the Lord

Literally, Rebekah's response is an incomplete sentence: “if so, why then am I...” which can be 
interpreted to mean “why do I go on living?” or “why did I desire to become pregnant?”[^14] It was 
foretold by God that a consequence of Adam and Eve’s sin would be pain in conceiving children. 
Perhaps, a manifestation of that pain is seen in Rebekah's difficult pregnancy and her reaction to 
it. The root word used in [Genesis 3:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/3/16),
translated “childbearing” (ESV,) is the same root word used in 
[Genesis 25:21](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25:21), translated “conceived” (ESV): *h-r-h*.

> <sup>16</sup> To the woman he said, “I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing [root 
*h-r-h*]; in pain you shall bring forth children."
>
> --Genesis 3:16a (ESV)

> <sup>21</sup> ... And the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived [root *h-r-h*].
>
> --Genesis 25:21b (ESV)

Rebekah “inquires of the Lord” because of what’s happening to her. Commentators note that this would
typically involve going to a prophet or sacred space. Conjectures include:
* Beer-lahai-roi, where God spoke to Hagar.[^15]
* Abraham, although it's unlikely.[^16] Abraham may not actually be alive at this time despite the 
fact that if Biblical ages are taken literally, he would be (Abraham would be 160 when Isaac is 60, 
35 years before Abraham’s death.) Abraham is conspicuously absent in 
[Genesis 24:62-67](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/24/62-67), implying that he died before his 
servant returned to Isaac with Rebekah.[^17]

Regardless, the Bible doesn’t dwell on how Rebekah inquired of the Lord, stating only that she does 
and that God answers. Isaac turned to God as a response to Rebekah's barrenness; Rebekah turns to 
God in response to her difficult pregnancy.

### Oracle

> <sup>23</sup> And the LORD said to her, 
>
> &ensp;&ensp;“Two nations are in your womb,  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;and two peoples from within you shall be divided;  
&ensp;&ensp;the one shall be stronger than the other,  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;the older shall serve the younger.”
>
> --Genesis 25:23 (ESV)

This verse is parallel to God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3.

> Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the 
land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your
name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors 
you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”
>
> --Genesis 12:1-3 (ESV)

God's promise to Abraham in Genesis 12 establishes the mission for his family and the Israelite 
nation that will come from it.[^18] Rebekah's oracle, being compared to the promise given to 
Abraham, invites the question: how will the conflict foretold result in a nation of blessing?

God’s answer to Rebekah's inquiry is presented in the form of a poem. As is typically in biblical 
poetry, it's in pairs of lines with the second line in each pair developing and intensifying the 
first.[^19]

> "Two nations are in your womb"

The first line is a confirmation of the promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many 
nations. 

> "and two peoples from within you shall be divided"

The second line develops the first with a negative aspect: the peoples of the two nations will be 
divided. The root Hebrew word for “divided” (*p-r-d*) is the same root word used for the nations 
descended from Noah’s children with their own languages (the Babel story explains how they ended 
up with different languages,) and the separation of Abraham and Lot in
[Genesis 13:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/13/14).

> "the one shall be stronger than the other"

In the third line, God reveals that one nation will be stronger than the other.

> "the older shall serve the younger"

The last line gives us the twist: the nation descended from the older shall serve the younger. 
However, it doesn’t suggest that the younger child is therefore more favored by God or to be more 
favored by Isaac and Rebekah; it’s about the nations that descend from them.[^20]. The words “sons” 
or “children” are absent from the oracle.

This line is more ambiguous in Hebrew. The word translated “older” (*rav*) is never translated that 
way elsewhere in the ESV, and a different word is used to describe Esau as the older son later in 
the Jacob story (*gadol*, see [Genesis 27:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/1), for 
example) which is interestingly the same word used in God’s promise to make Abraham into a “great" 
(*gadol*) nation. Perhaps *gadol* is purposefully avoided in the oracle? Similarly, the word 
translated “younger” (*sa’ir*) has a connotation of “little, insignificant,” not only young. As 
with *godol* and Esau, *sa’ir* is not used later to describe Jacob as the younger son (*qatan* is 
used instead, see [Genesis 27:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/15).)

While we know who is the older/greater and who is the younger/lesser, as did the original audience 
of the story, in the narrative, Isaac and Rebekah do not, so the oracle represents a test for them. 
They aren’t given instruction about how to raise their children. Their biases and action or inaction
are their own choices. Will they “see and take” or patiently trust God?

The oracle develops the established theme in Genesis of a younger or lesser son be chosen over the 
firstborn. Abel, Seth, and Isaac weren't firstborn sons.[^21] The story of the Bible is showing us 
that being chosen by God is an act of grace, not a natural right. Also, the Bible often shows us 
how the firstborn children choose to become the seed of the serpent rather than the seed of the 
woman. We'll see this with Esau.

### Birth

> <sup>24</sup> When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
<sup>25</sup> The first came out red, all his body like a hairy cloak, so they called his name Esau.
<sup>26</sup> Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel, so his name was 
called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
>
> --Genesis 25:24-26 (ESV)

Rebekah indeed has twins. In contrast to [Genesis 21:5](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/21/5) 
where Isaac is described as being born "to him (Abraham,)" Esau and Jacob aren't described as being
born "to Isaac." As discussed in the [The toledot of Isaac](#the-toledot-of-isaac), Abraham was 
disconnected from Ishmael in the narrative by not stating that Abraham fathered him. Here, Isaac 
isn't said to have fathered Esau and Jacob, either, only that Rebekah bore them. So, Isaac is 
distanced from his sons. Why? One reason could be that by de-emphasizing Isaac, God's role in the
childrens' birth is being accented. Another could be that the ambiguity of the oracle is being 
maintained. If one son was stated to be fathered by Isaac and the other wasn't, the tension would be
prematurely relieved.

Her children are described with wordplay that alludes to their personalities and future.

#### Esau

Esau is "red" and "hairy." “Red” is *admoni* in Hebrew, which starts with the same three letters as 
Edom, the nation that will descend from him. The similarity between the words is more apparent with 
Hebrew letters (note that Hebrew is read right to left.)

| Hebrew | Transliteration |
| ---: | --- |
| אַדְמוֹנִי | *admoni* |
| אֱדוֹם | *edom* |

"Hairy" is *se‘ar* in Hebrew, a play on the region within Edom that Esau will settle.[^22]

#### Jacob

Jacob is born grasping Esau's heel. "Jacob" in Hebrew is *ya‘aqov*, a play on "heel" in Hebrew: 
*‘aqev*. This explanation of Jacob's name establishes his behavioral pattern for the rest of the 
story. He'll consistently grasp for what he wants on his own terms.

*ya‘aqov* is also a shortened form of the name *ya‘aqov-el*, which means "may God protect."[^23] 
A double meaning could be intended. Despite Jacob's schemes, God protects him.

#### Parallels with the Epic of Gilgamesh

Esau and Jacob share similarities with Enkidu and Gilgamesh, respectively, from the ancient 
Mesopotamian epic poem *Epic of Gilgamesh*. These parallels are strongest in the wrestling scene in 
[Genesis 32:22-32](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/15), but there are notable examples here,
also, that strengthen the connections to the poem in Genesis 32.[^24]

Most historians agree that Gilgamesh was a historical king of the Sumerian city-state Uruk who was 
poetically elevated to part-god status after his death. In the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, he's described 
as 2/3 god and 1/3 human. His mother was the goddess Ninsun and his father was Lugalbanda, a king 
of Uruk.

In the beginning of the ancient poem, Gilgamesh is portrayed as a tyrant who takes what isn't his: 
he sleeps with new brides on their wedding nights. The people of Uruk petition the gods for help. 
The gods respond by creating Enkidu as a rival to Gilgamesh.

> The goddess Aruru, she washed her hands,  
&ensp;&ensp;took a pinch of play, threw it down in the wild.  
In the wild she created Enkidu, the hero,  
&ensp;&ensp;offspring of silence, knit strong by Ninurta.  
All his body is matted with hair,  
&ensp;&ensp;he bears long tresses like those of a woman:  
the hair of his head head grows thickly as barley,  
&ensp;&ensp;he knows not a people, nor even a country.  
Coated in hair like the god of the animals,  
&ensp;&ensp;with the gazelles he grazes on grasses,  
joining the throng with the game at the water-hole,  
&ensp;&ensp;his heart delighting with the beasts in the water.  
>
> --The Epic of Gilgamesh (Tablet I, lines 101-112)[^25]

Note the similar hairy descriptions of Esau and Enkidu. Also, we'll see that Esau's domain is away 
away from camp with the animals, and will demonstrate animalistic behaviors.

In contrast to Enkidu, Gilgamesh is portrayed as fair, civilized, wise, and a recipient of dream-
visions. Gilgamesh is described to Enkidu as follows.

> 'He is fair in manhood, dignified in bearing,  
&ensp;&ensp;graced with charm in his whole person.  
He has a strength more mighty than yours,  
&ensp;&ensp;unsleeping as he is by day and by night.  
The gods Anu, Enlil and Ea have broadened his wisdom.  
>
>'Before you even came from the uplands,  
&ensp;&ensp;Gilgamesh in Uruk was seeing you in dreams:'
>
> --The Epic of Gilgamesh (Tablet I, lines 236-239, 242-244)[^26]

Parallels can be seen between Gilgamesh and Jacob.

| Gilgamesh | Jacob |
| --- | --- |
| Fair | "Smooth" |
| Charming, wise | Crafty, deceptive |
| Given visions by the gods | Given visions by Yahweh |

As mentioned, overall parallels between the two stories are strongest in the later wrestling scene. 
Nevertheless, here, the more subtle parallels could be reinforcing the idea of Esau and Jacob as 
rivals beside setting up future links between the two stories.

## Esau and Jacob contrasted

> <sup>27</sup> When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob 
was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved 
Jacob.
>
> --Genesis 25:27 (ESV)

Esau is a “skillful hunter, a man of the field.” He doesn’t spend his time at camp, but rather in 
the field hunting animals. Jacob is a “quiet man, dwelling in tents.” The Hebrew word translated 
“quiet” is *tam*, and has been difficult to translate. Elsewhere in the Bible, it’s used to describe 
someone with high moral character 
([Job 1:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/job/1/1),
[Psalm 15:2](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/psalms/15/2), 
[Proverbs 10:9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/proverbs/10/9)) This doesn’t fit the Jacob we see in 
the Biblical story. It could be used here as a puzzle intended to cause us to reflect on the 
complicated nature of Jacob.[^27] Or, it could mean “bent on one purpose”.[^28] It could also invite
comparison between Abimelech in [Genesis 20:5](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/20/5,) which 
will be explored later.

Isaac and Rebekah's favoritism develops the differences between their sons and points to division 
and future conflict. Isaac loves Esau because he “ate of his game.” Later, Isaac is described as 
loving his favorite food three times, so this love of food is emphasized and it’s made clear that 
he has preference for Esau because of the food he’s able to provide him. The reason for Rebekah's 
preference for Jacob isn't explicitly given, but the story may hint at the reason as it progresses.

## Esau sells his birthright to Jacob

### Cultural significance of the birthright

The predominance of the firstborn son is well documented in the region and time of ancient Israel 
(Sumeria, Mari, Nuzi, and Middle Assyrian laws.) He was second in rank only to the family 
patriarch and would become his successor.[^29] He would also receive a double share of the 
inheritance.[^30]

Birthright in Hebrew, *bekorah*, is an anagram of blessing, *berakah*, a major theme in 
Genesis.[^31] In the early arcs of the Jacob Cycle, we see Jacob seizing both authority and 
blessing from Esau.

### The sale of the birthright

> <sup>29</sup> Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted.
<sup>30</sup> And Esau said to Jacob, “[Please] let me eat some of that red stew, for I am 
exhausted!” (Therefore his name was called Edom.) <sup>31</sup> Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright
now.” <sup>32</sup> Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” <sup>33</sup>
Jacob said, “Swear to me now.” <sup>34</sup> So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. 
<sup>34</sup> Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his 
way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
>
> --Genesis 25:29-34 (ESV)

The scene opens with Jacob cooking stew. The kind of stew isn’t revealed to make the scene more 
tragic at its end. Esau comes in from the field exhausted. In the ancient Near East, one would 
more likely be exhausted from exertion or thirst rather than hunger. When the object is a person, 
most instances of the Hebrew word translated "exhausted" (*‘ayeph*) in the Bible refer to someone 
who is thirsty, so perhaps what Esau really needed was rest and water.[^32] Nevertheless, 
it's possible he’s truly extremely weary.[^33]

The ESV doesn't translate the word, but Esau says "please" (Hebrew *na‘*) in verse 30, in contrast
to the demanding way Jacob speaks to him later. Nevertheless, Esau's speech is animalistic. The
Hebrew word translated "eat" is *halite*, which is a verb used for the feeding of animals. A 
translation capturing the essence of Esau's request could be "let me cram my maw with that red-red."
[^34]

Literally, Esau asks to for some of "the red, the red." The repetition of "red" might suggest a deep
red stew. An explanation is given for Esau being called Edom, the nation that would come from him. 
Here, "red" is *adom*, the root word for *admoni* seen in verse 25 (see [Esau](#esau).) *adom* also 
sounds like the Hebrew word for "blood," *dam*. There's wordplay between Edom and *dam* later in the
Bible ([Joel 3:19](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/joel/3/19);) perhaps Esau thought that "the red, the
red" was blood broth, believed to be life essence, or meat stew.[^35]

Jacob, cold and calculating, demands that Esau immediately sell him his birthright. Esau, thinking 
that he’ll die without the food, agrees. He’s too much a slave of the moment to consider the great 
ramifications of the transaction.[^36] To ensure that he gets what he wants, Jacob tells Esau to 
swear to him. In the ancient Near East, such an oath may have been considered irrevocable.[^37]

It's revealed that the stew is only lentils, not blood broth or meat, intensifying the inequity of 
the arrangement. We get four verbs in quick succession ("he **ate** and **drank** and **rose** and 
**went**") with no more dialogue, which is chilling considering what just happened.[^38] Esau 
satisfied his appetite and left without further comment.

The Bible doesn’t often directly comment on whether something that happened is good or bad, so 
the statement "Thus Esau despised his birthright" is unusual and significant.[^39] We’re being shown
why Esau is disqualified from being the chosen child of promise. If he is treats the birthright, 
something of great value in his time and place, so flippantly, how can he be trusted with carrying
on the blessing of the seed of the woman? Nevertheless, Jacob doesn’t present himself as a much 
better option. There’s still more to reflect on as the story progresses. Still, it’s perhaps 
significant that Esau doesn’t seem to care much about the rights of the firstborn, while Jacob does.
[^40] While Jacob isn’t loyal to God at this point, his heart is somewhat oriented towards the 
commission given to humanity in the beginning.

Esau is following the lead of Adam and Eve in the garden. Esau called Edom, which sounds like Adam,
trades his birthright, which included authority, for food he thought was more substantial than it 
turned out to be because he thought he was going to die. Adam and Eve traded their right to rule 
for food they thought would make them like gods (*elohim*,) being promised that they wouldn’t die. 
But, Jacob is the the deceiver in this story. The literary design of the section even has Jacob 
encircling Esau.[^41] Perhaps like a coiling serpent?

&ensp;&ensp;Said Jacob: sell me your birthright  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Said Esau: I leave, I die; of what use is a birthright to me?  
&ensp;&ensp;Said Jacob: swear to me first; so he swore and sold it

This section doesn’t explicitly say that Jacob bought the birthright, only that Esau sold it. Other
transactions in the Bible
([Abraham’s purchase of a burial cave](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/23/3-17), 
[David’s purchase of a threshing floor](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2-samuel/24/21-24)) follow a 
formula that states that the purchaser actually bought what was sold to them. It’s left out here to
distance Jacob’s eventual authority from the means he used to get it.[^42] That is, Jacob’s
actions aren’t what establish him as the chosen seed of the woman.

## Conclusion

The beginning of the Jacob Cycle sets the trajectory for the rest of the story. Through God's 
oracle, it's revealed that he will chose the one to carry on the blessing given to Abraham. Human 
traditions and expectations won't be the determining factors. Paul comments on this in Romans.[^43]

> <sup>10</sup> And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our 
forefather Isaac, <sup>11</sup> though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or 
bad—in order that God’s purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him 
who calls—"
>
> Romans 9:10-11 (ESV)

At this point, Jacob doesn't understand or trust that God's grace will grant him authority and 
blessing, so he instead grasps for it as he did Esau's heel. Nevertheless, the story will show that
despite selfish human machinations, his plan to save humanity won't be thwarted.
