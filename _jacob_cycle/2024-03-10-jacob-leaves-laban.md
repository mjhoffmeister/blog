**The Jacob Cycle - Part 10**

This section is parallel to Jacob’s arrival to Haran in Genesis 29 and his experience at Bethel in Genesis 28. There are also references to Jacob’s stealing Isaac’s blessing.

Parallel to Genesis 21:8-21? Needs investigation.

Genesis 31:1-3 - Jacob learns that Laban’s attitude towards him has changed. Jacob’s wealth has come at the expense of Laban and he’s now seen as a thief. God speaks to him and calls him back to the land and reiterates the promise at Bethel to be with him (Genesis 28:15.) God’s words echoe those he gave to Abraham when he called him our of Haran in Genesis 12:1-2. Whereas for Abraham it was the first time he entered the land and received God’s promise, here Jacob is returning to the land with a renewed promise (Wenham: 268). The “angels” are ascending the stairway back to the “gate of heaven.”

Genesis 31:4-9 - Perhaps for secrecy, Jacob meets with his wives in the field where his flock was (Sarna: 214). In verses 4 and 14, Rachel is listed before Leah, showing that Jacob maintains his preference for her (Wenham: 270) and that there’s perhaps more trouble to come because of it.

Three times, Jacob illustrates how God has guarded and blessed through Laban’s mistreatment of him.

1. Laban changed his attitude towards Jacob, but God was with Jacob
2. Laban cheated Jacob and changed Jacob’s wages “10 times” (means repeatedly, but God didn’t allow Laban to harm Jacob
3. Laban tried to give Jacob little, but God took much from Laban and gave it to Jacob. "Taken away” is literally “rescued.” The word is used repeatedly in Exodus to describe God delivering Israel from slavery. So, this perhaps points to Israel in Egypt, but also indicates that it is good for the animals to be in Jacob’s care because they were in a kind of “bondage” before.

Jacob’s details are different from the narration of the events in Genesis 30, but it may be more a shift in perspective than an intention to deceive. Jacob sees that God has been the one to protect and bless him and wants to convey that to his wives (Ibid.)

Genesis 31:10-13 - Jacob elaborates on God speaking to him in Gen 31:3. This dream-vision is strongly linked to his dream at Bethel. He sees a vision of goats “mating.” The word is literally “ascending” like the angels on the stairway in Genesis 28:12. After the visual aspect of each dream, there’s a corresponding speech. Both end with a call to action for Jacob.

The angels ascending and descending were connected God’s chosen people entering and leaving the land and God’s promise to be with Jacob as he went and returned to and from the land. While the verbal element of this dream is simply a reiteration of the visual aspect, Jacob earlier noted that it was God who “rescued” the animals and gave them to Jacob (Wenham: 271). This augments the Bethel dream by connecting entering the land and ascending to the gate of heaven with God rescuing. God isn’t rescuing only Jacob, however; he returns with flocks, servants, camels and donkeys. The single child of promise is bringing others with him back to Yahweh.

Genesis 31:14-16 - Rachel and Leah express that they feel like outcasts and are eager to leave with Jacob. They say literally that Laban has “eaten up” their money. This idiom is connected with pocketing a bride-price outside the Bible. Jacob worked for 14 years instead of paying a bride-price, so Rachel and Leah should have been entitled to 14 years’ wages, but Laban’s selfishness has left them with no hope of receiving it (Sarna: 215). They affirm that Jacob’s wealth is from God and commit to following his command.

Genesis 31:17-21 - Jacob’s escape is connected to Abraham’s move from Harran to Canaan, Jacob’s later move to Egypt, and the exodus. He left during sheep-shearing season because Laban was away. We receive a note about Rachel stealing household gods or idols. Later in the Bible they’re connected with divination, linking back to Genesis 30:27. It also recall’s Jacob’s theft of Isaac’s blessing before he left home.

“Deceived” is literally “stole the heart of.” “Heart” is lev which is a play on “Laban,” and “Aramean” is very close to the work “cheat” in Hebrew. The point is that Jacob has out-tricked the trickster (Sarna: 216). The focus on Laban as an Aramean illustrates the divide between him and Jacob. Laban is no longer family, he represents “the nations.” When Rachel commanded Jacob to flee to Haran, she literally said “arise, flee.” Here, Jacob “fled” and “arose.” The word reversal illustrates the change in direction (Sarna: 217.)

Genesis 31:22-35 - Laban eventually catches up with Jacob. There is a lot of language used that creates the connotation of a hostile environment, but God speaks to Laban and warns him against harming Jacob.

Laban tries to paint himself as a victim and accuses Jacob of stealing his gods. Jacob defends himself and invites Laban to search for his gods. Laban “feels” all around the tent. This links back to Isaac “feeling” the disguised Jacob in Genesis 27:22 (Wenham: 276). Jacob disguised himself under animal skins. Rachel hides Laban’s gods inside an animal’s saddle. She sits on the saddle, claiming she can’t rise because she’s on her period. If this is true, she is culturally unclean and Laban can’t approach. Furthermore, she would be making the idols unclean. In a sense Laban’s gods have been defeated along with Laban himself. He searched three times but found nothing.

Genesis 31:36-42 - Vindicated, Jacob fully lays out his grievances against Laban. Verse 42 has strong links to the Exodus. “Send away” is often used to describe Pharoah sending Israel out of Egypt, and Moses promised Israel that they wouldn’t leave Israel “empty-handed.” The end of his speech is a decisive confession that it was God who guarded and blessed him (Wenham: 277).

Genesis 31:43-54 - Laban pathetically insists that everything Jacob has is his, but he knows he’s defeated. So, he moves to make a treaty with the more powerful Jacob as protection against revenge. Jacob sets up a stone pillar and asks that both groups build a “heap” (gal,) giving meaning to the name Galeed (“heap of witness”) and adding additional meaning to Gilead (both names have the same consonants.) The reason for two witnesses could be an indication of the mistrust between Jacob and Laban and a link to Deuteronomy 19:15. Stones continue to be witnesses to pivotal moments in Jacob’s life. Laban names the place “heap of witness” in Aramaic (Wenham: 279). Other than accenting the note on Genesis 31:20, it perhaps solidifies the Babylonian background of the story. The other name Jacob gives is “the watch tower.”

Other than being witnesses, the heap and pillar serve as boundary stones. Lines have been drawn between Jacobs god(s) and Laban’s gods.

Later, Jacob will flee Laban and be pursued by him, but the two 
will ultimately make peace by setting up a pillar with stones that Jacob will call
