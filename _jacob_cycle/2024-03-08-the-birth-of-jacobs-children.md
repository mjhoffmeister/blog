**The Jacob Cycle - Part 8**

This episode is about the birth of Jacob’s children in Haran: eleven sons and one daughter. The birth stories are arranged by the four mothers of the children: Jacob’s wives and their maids (Sarna: 206). There are links back to earlier parts of the Jacob story and earlier parts of Genesis (Wenham: 240).

Another aspect of the story is the tension between Leah and Rachel. Leah wants to become a loved (or the preferred) wife and Rachel wants to become a mother. Each sister wants what the other has (Olszewska: 347).

In Genesis 49, Jacob prophesies the destinies of the tribes that will come from his sons. Here we have a micro view with the names of his children being connected to the circumstances around their individual births.

Leah’s first four sons
Genesis 29:31-35

When God “sees,” he intends to act to correct an injustice. He “saw” the wickedness on the earth before the flood. He “saw” that Noah was righteous so he was saved from the flood. He came down to “see” the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah. After Hagar was abused by Sarai/Sarah and fled from her, God promised to increase her descendents, and she said Yahweh was a God that “sees” her (Wenham: 242). So, God sees Leah being “unloved” (“loved less”) as an injustice that needs to be addressed. (Note: the word for “hated” takes on the less severe connotation of “unloved” or “loved less” in past participle form according to some commentators [Sarna: 206, Wenham: 242]. See Malachi 1:3.)

It’s again being shown that it’s by God’s power that line of the blessed seed of the woman continues. In contrast to Isaac praying to God to resolve Rebekah’s infertility in Genesis 25:21, Jacob doesn’t have the faith (nor the care, likely) to pray for Leah. Nonetheless, God takes the initiative to bless Leah with children. Once again, we have a reversal of Jacob’s previous actions. Jacob tricked Isaac into giving him the blessing intended for Esau. The “blessing” of fruitfulness and multiplication that Jacob surely wanted for Rachel is first given to Leah by God (Olszewska: 352).

 We noted that after Rebekah gave birth to Esau and Jacob in Genesis 25:26, Isaac was de-emphasized by not following the common formula of “Isaac fathered” or “she bore them to Isaac.” We see the same thing here. In fact, Jacob’s name is missing altogether in these verses, and every other time a son is born the mother is said to have born him “to Jacob.” Every other time except for Joseph, that is. Judah and Joseph are emphasized. (Judah is emphasized because after he’s born, Leah stops bearing children for a time, perhaps signaling the next child of promise has been born.)

Reuben - Leah conceived and bore a son
Simeon - (Leah) conceived again and bore a son
Levi - (Leah) conceived again and bore a son
Judah - (Leah) conceived again and bore a son
And (Leah) ceased bearing

The first son born to Leah is Reuben (re’uven.) Reuben is a play on “the Lord has seen my misery” (ra’ah be ‘onyi). Leah hopes that with the birth of Jacob’s first son, she’ll become loved, or possibly the favored wife (Sarna:  206). It’s interesting that she uses God’s name, Yahweh. This suggests at least some knowledge of him. However, she sees God’s gift as a way to achieve her own goals (Olszewska: 355).

The second born is Simeon (shimohn). Similarly, the name is a wordplay on “the Lord heard I am not loved” (shama yhwh ki-senu a anoki) (Sailhaner: 464). She again mentions Yahweh, but it’s still related to what she wants. She sees Simeon as consolation for not getting what she really wants (Olszewska: 355).

The third is Levi (lewi). It’s a wordplay on “my husband will become attached” (yillaweh  ishi) (Wenham: 464). Leah doesn’t mention Yahweh at all, as if she’s forgotten him.

The names of her first three children are all connected to the suffering she experiences because of Jacob’s rejection (Olszewska: 355).

The fourth, Judah (yehudah), is a play on “I will praise the Lord” (‘odeh et yahweh) (Ibid.) Somehow, after the birth of her fourth child, she is able to shift her focus away from her desires and onto Yahweh (Olszewska: 355).

Bilhah’s two sons
Genesis 30:1-8 

In contrast to God’s response to “seeing,” Rachel “seeing” Yahweh’s kindness to Leah results in jealousy. She follows the path of Sarah in Genesis 16:2 and gives Jacob her maid to have children through her, but her verbal reaction is much stronger than Sarah’s, and is in stark contrast to Isaac and Rebekah’s response in Genesis 25:21. Furthermore, Sarah and Rebekah waited many more years than Rachel. Rachel places blame on Jacob who responds defensively with at least an undertone that suggests she should be appealing to God, not Jacob (Wenham: 242). Tragically, though she said she would die if she didn’t have children, it’s getting what she wants that kills her. She dies giving birth to Benjamin in Genesis 35:16-19. 

Nevertheless she gives Bilhah to Jacob so that she can have children through her instead of relying on God. She uses the same words as Sarah in Genesis 16:2, “obtain children by her” (‘ibbaneh mim enah) (Ibid.) “On my behalf” is literally “to give birth over my knees” and suggests adoption. Any child Bilhah has will be Rachel’s (Wenham: 244).

Jacob complies, but in contrast  to how Abraham did with Sarah. In Genesis 16:2, Abraham “obeyed” Sarah. Jacob, here, literally “went in to her.” This perhaps is distancing Jacob from the act (Ibid.) He’s becoming a passive figure being acted upon by his wives, as Isaac was acted upon by Jacob and Rebekah. The reversal of Jacob’s past continues. Note that these sons are born “to Jacob.”

Dan - Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son
Naphtali - Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son

Dan is a play on dannan, “vindicated.” While Rachel says that God heard her, suggesting that she prayed, the narrator doesn’t say that God intervened on Rachel’s behalf until verse 22 right before the birth of Joseph, so doubt is at least cast on God approving of the surrogate marriage (Wenham: 244).

Naphtali is a play on naphtulim, “contests.” The adjective “mighty” or “great” is actually elohim “God/of God.” Rachel perhaps sees the contest with Leah as one for divine favor or blessing. naphtulim isn’t used in the later wrestling match between God and Jacob (ye’a,beq is used in Genesis 32:24,) but that story is linked to this verse with the keyword “prevailed” (ykl) - God tells Jacob that he has striven with God and men and prevailed. Here, Rachel sees herself as having striven with God and Leah and prevailed.

Zilpah’s two sons
Genesis 30:9-13

Leah’s “seeing” results in restoring to Rachel and Sarah’s responses to infertility. She gives her maid Zilpah to Jacob to have children through her. These children are also born “to Jacob.” Note that she doesn’t say God’s name here and there might be pagan deity undertones. Rather than drawing closer to Yahweh, Leah is allowing herself to be pushed away from him.

Gad - Zilpah bore Jacob a son
Asher - Zilpah bore Jacob a second son

Gad means “good luck” or “fortune.” It was also the name of a god of luck in the region, as seen in Isaiah 65:11. Leah probably isn’t explicitly naming Gad after a pagan god here, but there could be religious overtones (Wenham: 245).

Asher is a play on “happy am I” (be ashri.) The root a-sh-r is used in Psalm 1 and is behind the word “blessed” in the beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount. It means commendable or enviable, seeming blessed from the perspective of an observer. It could also be connected to Asherah, a goddess in the Canaanite pantheon: wife of El, the head of the pantheon, and mother of the minor gods (Wenham: 245, Wyatt: 99). Leah literally says “daughters will call be happy,” which points to the birth of Dinah in Gen 30:21. 

Mandrakes
Genesis 30:14-16

This scene is a reversal Jacob manipulating Esau into selling him the birthright. Esau, the firstborn, had returned from the field empty-handed from a hunt. Reuben, the firstborn, returns from the field having found mandrakes (Walton: 593). Rachel wants to trade Leah for the mandrakes because they were believed to be an aphrodisiac and fertility drug, ostensibly so she could use them to try get to conceive (the Hebrew word for the plant, dudadim, sounds like the word for “love,” dodim. Love and mandrakes are linked together in Song of Solomon 7:12-13 [Sarna: 209].) Jacob wanted to trade Esau lentil soup for his birthright. 

Leah is incensed at the request because she feels that Rachel already has claim to Jacob and has no right to take anything more from her. So, a bargain is struck: Leah may sleep with Jacob in return for the mandrakes. The verb used for sleep/lie here, sh-k-v connects this scene with other stories where someone is taken advantage of sexually. Lot’s daughters “sleep” with him after they fled Sodom so that they could have children. Later in the Jacob story, the same word is used to describe the rape of Dinah in Genesis 34. Jacob is now the one to be taken advantage of.

Jacob is described returning from the field with the exact same phrase as Esau at the beginning of the birthright story.

And came Esau from the field - Genesis 25:29 
And came Jacob from the field - Genesis 30:16

Jacob, reduced to a passive object with no agency, seems to have no choice because Leah has “hired” him. “Hire” is a keyword in narrative arc where Jacob stays with Laban. Laban’s relationship with Jacob is based on what he can gain from him, and now Jacob’s relationship with his wives has been reduced to the same (Wenham: 247). Jacob is being treated as he treated Esau and Isaac.

Leah’s last children
Genesis 30:17-21

It’s the one who gave up the mandrakes who next has children. The narrative again shows us that it’s not by human effort that the fledgling nation of Israel will be fruitful and multiply, but by God’s power. Rachel, who now possesses the mandrakes, is barren for apparently three more years (Sarna: 209).

Two more sons are born “to Jacob” by Leah.

Issachar is a play on “rewarded me” (shekari) and “ my husband” (ishi.) She sees giving up a maid to be a concubine to her husband as a great sacrifice that has been rewarded (Wenham: 247). It further shows her descent away from God after praising him after the birth of Judah. He focus has returned to getting Jacob’s favor.

Zebulun is a play on “presented/give” (zebada) and “honor” (yizbele). She expresses that she sees the six children she’s born as a means to the end of getting Jacob’s attention (Olszewska: 356).

She also has a daughter, Dinah. The root word behind Dinah means “judgment/vindication,” so the recording of the birth of a daughter, which is rare in the Bible, acts partially to punctuate Leah’s feeling for triumph. It also looks ahead to the story surrounding her in Genesis 34 where there’s another story about judgment and vindication (Wenham: 247.)

Rachel’s first son
Genesis 30:22-24

This section ends with the birth of Joseph. Rachel apparently did eventually pray because “God listened to her,” but God listening is preceding by God remembering. God “remembering” doesn’t mean that God had forgotten Leah and now recalls it; he’s focusing in on a situation and taking action (Sarna: 56). God’s grace is emphasized as the reason for Rachel having Joseph (Wenham: 247). Like with Leah’s first four sons, Joseph isn’t born “to Jacob.” 

Joseph is a play on “taken away” (asaph) and “add” (yoseph.) Rachel does invoke Yahweh’s name, but only to get more of what she wants. As noted, her prayer is answered, but at the cost of her life.
