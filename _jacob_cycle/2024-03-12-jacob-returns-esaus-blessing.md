**The Jacob Cycle - Part 12**

Jacob crosses the Jabbok
Genesis 32:22-24a

Jacob helps his family and the rest of his possession across the river Jabbok, a barrier between him and the land. Strangely, he does this at night and then apparently goes back across, away from the land, so that he’s alone (Wenham: 290). That Jacob “got up” suggests that he was trying to sleep but couldn’t (Fokkelman: 221). This section is parallel to Jacob stealing Isaac’s blessing from Esau. There, he deceived his blind father by masquerading as Esau. That should be in our minds as we continue.

Jacob wrestles God
Genesis 32:24b-32

Out of the seven scenes that describe Jacob’s return to Canaan, this is the fourth, so the middle, one (Wenham: 292). Furthermore, this is the fourth, the middle occurrence of the world “overpower/prevail,” the first being when the shepherds in Haran were unable to “prevail” against the stone over the well. This obstacle is emphasized. 

A man is suddenly wrestling Jacob. There’s a play on words between “Jabbok” (yaboq,) “Jacob” (ya’aqov,) and “wrestled” (ye’avek.) In Genesis 27:36, Esau laments that Jacob “Jacob-ed” (cheated) him twice. That was linked back to Isaac “Isaac-ing” Rebekah in Genesis 26:8. Isaac deceiving Abimelek into believing Rebekah was his sister was shown to be unnecessary, because they had been in Gerar “a long time” (Gen 26:8) without issue. So, too, Jacob Jacob-ing Esau was unnecessary. God would have blessed Jacob without the masquerade. Here, the man is “Jacob-ing” Jacob himself (Wenham: 295), but this time it means wrestling. Perhaps the Isaac-ing, the Jacob-ing, all the scheming and deception is being revealed as Jacob wrestling with something or someone.

Who is the man? This is where the Epic of Gilgamesh links come full circle. Gilgamesh is on his way to carry out prima nocta when Enkidu intercepts him, so likely at night. Enkidu and Gilgamesh fight until Enkidu admits Gilgamesh’s supremacy, tells him his name, and blesses him, after which they become friends. If Esau is linked to Enkidu and Jacob to Gilgamesh, we would expect Esau to be the challenger. Instead, it’s God (Hamori: 637).

The man should be seen as a physical manifestation of God. The man connects Jacob’s new name with struggling with God and Jacob later says he has seen the face of God. In Genesis 48:15-16 when Jacob is blessing Joseph’s children, “God” and “angel” are set in parallel. In Hosea 12:3-4, struggling with God and struggling with the angel are linked and identified with Bethel where Yahweh appeared to Jacob (Heiser: 139).

Jacob’s fight isn’t and hasn’t really been with Esau or anyone else. Jacob’s been struggling against God with all his grasping, deception, and trickery. God could have easily destroyed Jacob at any point, but he worked through the difficult situations caused by Jacob’s schemes to protect the chosen seed of the woman. God could have easily beaten Jacob in a wrestling match, but he allows a stalemate to reshape Jacob into who he needs to be.

What Jacob needs to learn is where blessing really comes from. At the end of the match, God touches Jacob’s “hip socket” and injures him. Walton convincingly argues that this should be understood as the groin (Walton: 607). If this is true, God temporarily “takes away” Jacob’s ability to have more children. Jacob must have realized the supernatural nature of the man at this point and finally asks to be blessed by the true source of blessing (while clinging to him!) By asking Jacob his name, Jacob is forced to confess his nature: heel-grasper, cheat. He’s renamed Israel. In Genesis, naming someone exerts authority over them (Walton: 606). Adam named the animals in Genesis 2. After the fall in Genesis when God foretold that the woman’s husband would rule over her, Adam named her (Gen 3:20). Here, God claims authority over Jacob and blesses him.

Israel literally means “God fights.” In the context of this story, perhaps it’s an early indication about how God is going to win humanity back to him. God fights by incarnating himself in Jesus and losing his life on the cross.

Like with Bethel, a place where Jacob encountered God is renamed after light comes on a dark place. Jacob is left in awe at having seen the face of God and lived and so he names the place Peniel, which means “face of God.” Literally, he says he has been “rescued.”

Whatever part was injured, a corresponding part of animals is said to not be eaten by Israel as a commemoration of Jacob’s injury. This points to food purity laws which served to show Israel as a people set apart for God. Jacob has been made fully into the chosen child of promise.

Reconciliation
Genesis 33:1-11

Jacob sees Esau approaching. Even though his allegiance is now to Yahweh, vestiges of his old self remain. He divides his family so that his favorites are furthest away from potential danger. However, he now faces that potential danger first instead of sending everyone else ahead of him (Wenham: 298). 

Esau is happy to see Jacob, and they quickly reconcile. Jacob brings up “God” three times, reinforcing his new understanding of the source of blessing.

By bowing seven times to Esau, Jacob expresses subservience to him, and he convinces Esau to receive gifts, here re-framed as “blessing.” He’s returning the birthright and the blessing he previously stole.

Recall Isaac’s blessing in Genesis 27:29. Jacob is returning it to Esau! Next, he essentially returns the birthright with his generous gift. The firstborn was entitled to a double share of the inheritance.

Departure
Genesis 33:12-17 

Esau wants Jacob to return with him to Seir, but Jacob apparently doesn’t fully trust him and falls back on his deceitful ways to distance himself from Esau. Before entering Canaan, he settles in Succoth for a time, perhaps to recoup his losses after his gift to Esau (Sarna: 231), but the main point may be in the name. Succoth means “shelters,” emphasizing that God has fulfilled his promise to bring him safely back from Haran.

Return to Canaan
Genesis 33:18-20

Jacob finally returns to the land. Like Abraham when he first entered the land, he goes to Shechem and purchases land, therefore settling there. Also, like Abraham he builds and altar. The word “altar” is connected to “pillar.” God fulfilled his promise, and now Jacob fulfills his. He will worship Yahweh. El-elohe-yisrael means El, God of Israel (Sarna: 232).
