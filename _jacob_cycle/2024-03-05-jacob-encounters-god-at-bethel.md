**The Jacob Cycle - Part 5**

Essentially exiled, traveling from Beersheba toward Padam-aram (Haran,) Jacob stops for the night
and receives a dream-vision and message of assurance from God. This scene is parallel to God's
covenant with Abram in Genesis 15, where Abram, too, received a vision and assurance from God.

## Structure

The episode is structured through chiasm through keywords and phrases.[^1]

**Chiastic structure**

| --- |
| A. "place" - Genesis 28:11 |
| &ensp;&ensp; B. "stones," "headrest" - Genesis 28:11 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; C. "heaven," - Genesis 28:12 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; D. "God" (Elohim) - Genesis 28:12 | 
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; E. "The LORD" (Yahweh) - Genesis 28:13 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; F. Yahweh's promises to Jacob - Genesis 28:13-15 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; E'. "The LORD" (Yahweh) - Genesis 28:16 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; D'. "God": (Elohim) - Genesis 28:17 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; C'. "heaven" - Genesis 28:17 |
| &ensp;&ensp; B'. "stone," "headrest" - Genesis 28:18 | 
| A'. "place" - Genesis 28:19 |

Also through key words and phrases, Jacob's response to his dream is parallel to the dream,
itself.[^2]

**Parallel structure**

| Dream | Jacob's response |
| --- | --- |
| "place" - Genesis 28:11 | "place" - Genesis 28:16-17 |
| "stones," "headrest"  - Genesis 28:11 | "stone," "headrest" - Genesis 28:18 |
| "I am with you" - Genesis 28:15 | "If God will be with me" - Genesis 28:20 |
| "guard you wherever you go" - Genesis 28:15 | "guard me in this way that I go" - Genesis 28:20 |
| "bring you back to this land" - Genesis 28:15 | "return to my fatherâ€™s house" - Genesis 28:21 |
| "I will not leave you" - Genesis 28:16 | "Yahweh shall be my god" - Genesis 28:21 |

### Reversal of Babel

Jacob's dream can be seen as a reversal of the Babel story in
[Genesis 11:1-9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/11/1-9). There, humans tried to bridge the gap
between heaven and earth by building a tower in Babylon (*babel* is the Hebrew word for Babylon, 
and is translated as such everywhere in the Bible except for Genesis 11, apparently to maintain the 
Hebrew wordplay between *babel* and *balal*, which means "confuse," even though it can't be seen 
in English translations.) God's desire was for humans to "fill the earth and subdue it"
([Genesis 1:28](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/1/28),) so he frustrated their plans to gather
and reach for heaven by confusing their language and scattering them.

Babel is derived from the Akkadian *Bab-ili*, which mean "Gate of god" (or *Bab-ilani*, "Gate of
the gods.) There's scholarly consensus that the tower referred to in the Biblical story is the
ziggurat *E-temen-an-ki*, which means "House of the foundation of heaven and earth," part of the 
temple complex dedicated to Marduk, the supreme god of the Babylonian pantheon. (A ziggurat is a
multi-terraced pyramidal structure with a god's house on top, with each level connected by a
stairway or ramp.)[^3]

Remarkably, as with Jacob's dream, the Babel story is structured both chiastically and in parallel
panels.[^4]

**Chiastic structure**

| --- |
| A. "the whole earth had one language" - Genesis 11:1 |
| &ensp;&ensp; B. "there" - Genesis 11:2 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; C. "one another" - Genesis 11:3 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; D. "come let us make bricks" - Genesis 11:3 | 
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; E. "let us build ourselves" - Genesis 11:4 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; F. "a city and a tower" - Genesis 11:4 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; G. "The LORD (Yahweh) came down" - Genesis 11:5 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; F'. "the city and the tower" - 11:5 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; E'. "which the children of man had built" - Genesis 11:5 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; D'. "come, let us...confuse" - Genesis 11:7 |
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; C'. "one another's" - Genesis 11:7 |
| &ensp;&ensp; B'. "there" - Genesis 11:9 | 
| A'. "the language of all the earth" - Genesis 11:9 |

**Parallel structure**

| Human actions | God's response |
| --- | --- |
| "one language" - Genesis 11:1 | "one language" - Genesis 11:6 |
| "there" - Genesis 11:2 | "there" - Genesis 11:7 |
| "one another" - Genesis 11:3 | "one another's - Genesis 11:8 |
| "build...a city" - Genesis 11:4 | "building the city" - Genesis 11:8 |
| "name" - Genesis 11:4 | "its name" - Genesis 11:9 |
| "lest we be dispersed" - Genesis 11:4 | "dispersed them" - Genesis 11:9 |
| "over the face of the whole earth - Genesis 11:4 | "over the face of all the earth" - Genesis 11:9 |

Both Babel and Jacob's dream have a chiastic, tower-like structure with Yahweh at the top. Human 
actions are paralleled by God's response at Babel and the dream God gives Jacob is paralleled by
Jacob's response. Babel is therefore inverted and reversed at Bethel.

| --- | --- |
| Babel | Human action > divine response |
| Bethel | Divine action > human response |

### Parallels with the Abraham Cycle

There are many links to Abraham's vision in Genesis 15.

| Abram's vision | Jacob's dream |
| --- | --- |
| "Fear not, Abram" - Genesis 15:1 | "And [Jacob] was afraid" - Genesis 28:17 |
| "What will you give me?" - Genesis 15:2 | "Of all that you give me" - Genesis 28:22 |
| "The heir of my house is Eliezer" - Genesis 15:2 | "This stone... shall be God's house " - Genesis 28:22 |
| "Look toward heaven" - Genesis 15:5 | "The top of it reached heaven" - Genesis 28:12 |
| "So shall your offspring be [like the stars]" - Genesis 15:5 | "Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth - Genesis 28:14 |
| "As the sun was going down" - Genesis 15:12 | "The sun had set" - Genesis 28:11 |
| "You shall go to your fathers in peace" - Genesis 15:15 | "So that I come to my father's house in peace" - Genesis 28:21 |
| "They shall come back here" - Genesis 15:16 | "I will bring you back to this land" - Genesis 28:10 |
| "To your offspring I will give this land" - Genesis 15:18 | "The land on which you lie I will give to you and your offspring" - Genesis 28:13 |

Each scene has verbal and visual components demarcated by the phrase "and behold" (*wa hinneh*.)[^5]
While Abram's vision begins with the verbal elements, Jacob's dream ends with them.

| Verbal and visual elements in Abram's vision |
| --- |
| A. "And behold, a member of my household will ber my heir" - Genesis 15:3 |
| A'. "And behold... 'This man shall not be your heir'" - Genesis 15:4 |
| &ensp;&ensp; B. "And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him" - Genesis 15:12 |
| &ensp;&ensp; B'. "And behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between the pieces - Genesis 15:17 |

| Verbal and visual elements in Jacob's dream |
| --- |
| &ensp;&ensp; B. "And behold, there was a *sullam*" - Genesis 28:12a |
| &ensp;&ensp; B'. "And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it" - Genesis 28:12b |
| A. "And behold... 'The land on which you lie I will give' - Genesis 28:13 |
| A'. "'And behold... will bring you back to this land' - Genesis 28:15 |

Comparing these show the primary concerns of the patriarchs. Abram's concern is for offspring, while
Jacob's is the land, specifically returning to it. While God promises offspring and land to both
Abram and Jacob, his words to them speak to their specific situations.

## Jacob arrives at a "place"

> <sup>10</sup> Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran. <sup>11</sup> And he came to a certain
place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place,
he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep.
>
> --Genesis 28:10-11 (ESV)

Jacob is on his way to Haran to both flee from Esau and find a wife from Laban's house. His place of
departure and his destination highlight the element of exile. Beersheba is an echo of the garden of
Eden. There, Abraham planted a flowering tree (tamarisk) and both he and Isaac found wells, so it's
well watered. They both made covenants with the Philistines at the site, establishing peace with the
nations. Conversely, Haran was where Abram left to enter Canaan and in the region where the northern 
kingdom of Israel would be exiled. However, "Haran" is where Abraham was called by God and received
the first promises.[^6] So, even though Jacob is being exiled from the land, there is hope that 
wherever he goes, God can bring him back.

The word "place" (*maqom*) is emphasized by being repeated three times. At the end of the 
episode the unnamed "place" will undergo a transformation because of what happens there and be 
given a name.[^7] A theme of people and places being shrouded in darkness and revealed by
light is prevalent in the Jacob Cycle. Isaac was unable see Rebekah and Jacob's deception because 
of his dim eyes. Jacob is deceived by Leah and Laban in the evening, and he doesn't see who he
wrestles with at night on his way back to the land. It's often in the light of morning that the true 
nature of things or their transformations are seen.

Literally, Jacob "takes from the stones/one of the stones" to "arrange" a "headrest." The Hebrew is
ambiguous as to whether Jacob takes a single stone or multiple stones. If he took multiple, some
could have been placed around his head as a protective barrier. We know that at least one was used
as a kind of pillow because of what comes later; the stone, too, will undergo a
transformation/re-creation.[^8]

## Jacob's dream: visual aspect

As mentioned in [Parallels with the Abraham Cycle](#parallels-with-the-abraham-cycle,) the phrase 
"and behold" delineates one of the four parts of Jacob's dream. The first part introduces a
stairway. The second part, angels/messengers ascending and descending on it. Both aspects can take 
on two meanings: a vertical axis connecting heaven and earth and a horizontal axis leading to and 
from the promised land and exile in cosmic geography.[^9]

### The stairway

> <sup>12</sup> He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top
reaching to heaven...
>
> --Genesis 28:12a (NIV)

Along the vertical axis, the *sullam* bridges heaven and earth. With this meaning, it can refer to
the stairway or ramp linking each level of a ziggurat.[^10] As discussed in
[Reversal of Babel](#reversal-of-babel), this episode is, in part, a reversal of the Babel story
which subjects the building of Babylon and Marduk's ziggarat to Yahweh's will and the story of the
Bible. The phrase "with its top reaching to heaven" creates a strong link to the tower in Babel
whose builders wanted to build it with "its top in the heavens" 
([Genesis 11:4](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/11/4),) these being the only two places in the 
Bible where such a phrase is found. The parallelism communicates that it's God alone who can bring 
heaven and earth together.

### Angels ascending and descending

Jacob sees "angels" (*malake*, literally "messengers") going up (*â€˜olim*, root *â€˜lh*) and down
(*yor<sup>e</sup>dim*, root *yrd*) the stairway. 

the An attractive interpretation of the angels'
movement is that they represent the journeys of the patriarchs within cosmic geography. Abram is
described as going "down" to and "up" from Egypt.

> <sup>10</sup> Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down (*yered*, root *yrd*) to 
Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
>
> --Genesis 12:10 (ESV)

> <sup>1</sup> So Abram went up (*yaâ€˜al*, root *â€˜lh*) from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he
had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.
>
> --Genesis 13:1 (ESV)




Jacob is about to go from the land and God will promise him that heâ€™ll return to it. The words "return" and "go" we see later in Godâ€™s promises are linked to "ascend" and "descend" (Peleg: 66). That the angels are described first as ascending could be a link to Abraham first going from Ur into Canaan (Peleg: 111).

The word for "stairway" sullam (used only here in the Bible,) could be connected with the word mesillah, "highway," which is often used to describe a way back to the promised land from exile. Jeremiah 31:21 expresses this and uses many of the same words or synonyms of words we have in Jacobâ€™s dream story. The stairway represents a connection between heaven and earth and the way back from exile (Peleg: 95-96).

The word for "angels," malake (mala-KAY) literally means "messengers." Itâ€™s a puzzle that they give no verbal message (Peleg:102).

Thereâ€™s an Ancient Near East myth with a similar image. In Nergal and Ereshkigal, the gods of heaven are not allowed to descend to the underworld and vice versa:

"We (the gods of Heaven) are forbidden to descend to you (to Sheol) and you (Ereshkigal, queen of Sheol) are forbidden to ascend to us" (Peleg: ??)

Ereshkigal sends Nemtar as a messenger to receive her portion from the feast of the gods.

Nemtar ascended the long sullam of the heavens
Nergal descended the long sullam from the heavens

Nemtar is a messenger for Ereshkigal to request a portion from the feast of the gods. Later, the god Nergal rebelliously descends to the underworld to marry Ereshkigal.

Genesis: 28:13(a) - God is standing above the stairway. There could deliberately be two connotations to this. When God or his angel is described as standing, it can be read in one of two contrasting ways: either as a sentence of doom or the establishment of a covenant. We see this tension in Genesis 18:2 before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham sees three men, somehow recognizing God among them, and prepares a covenant meal after which God promises the birth of Isaac. Following that, God reveals heâ€™s come to judge the cities. This possibility is reinforced by Jacobâ€™s two responses to his dream, that "the Lord is in this place" (Gen 28:16) and "how frightening is this place" (Gen 28:17.)

The "god" of verse 12 reveals himself to be the God of Abraham and Isaac. Abraham is said to be Jacobâ€™s father rather than Isaac. This could be because Jacob is about to experience a kind of exile like Abraham did in Egypt (Peleg: 73). It could also illustrate that the continuity of these promises is due to Abrahamâ€™s obedience, not Isaacâ€™s or Jacobâ€™s.

Genesis 28:13-14 - the first part of the promise God gives to Jacob has four elements and is clearly linked to Godâ€™s promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:3, 13:14-16.

1. I will give the land to you and your offspring
2. Your offspring will be like the dust of the earth
3. You should spread to the west, east, north, and south
4. In you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed

Isaacâ€™s blessing is confirmed by Yahweh

Genesis 28:15 - the second part of the promise also has four elements surrounding Jacobâ€™s return to the land. While the first part of the promise looks far into the future, the second part regards the nearer term (Fokkelman: 61).

1. I am with you
2. I will guard you
3. I will bring you back to this land
4. I will not leave you until Iâ€™ve done what Iâ€™ve promised

Yahweh asserts himself to be a god of a particular land and a god that goes with his chosen one into a different land (Peleg 83). He isnâ€™t constrained by the boundary lines of other nations nor challenged by their gods.

Genesis 28:16-19 - Jacob awakes, marking the end of the dream (Peleg: 60.) In the morning (so the place in now in light) Jacob sees clearly. The "place" is the house of God and a gate of heaven. The "stone" is transformed, from pillar to one used in a religious ritual, consecrated by Jacob anointing it with oil (Peleg: 57). It is also a commemoration: the root for pillar, ntsb,  is the same word used to describe the stairway "resting" on the earth and Yahweh "standing" over it. He gives the place an apt name, Beth-el, "house of God," and the Bible tells us that the name of the (perhaps nearby) city was first named Luz, which means almond tree. (It was named after a fruit tree!)

Genesis 28:20-22 - Jacobâ€™s vow can be seen as an indication of his fledgling faith still being quite weak (Walton: 573). However, Jacob is perhaps deserving of some sympathy. He begins to worship as he knows how according to his cultural setting. He gave what he had, the stone and oil, and promised to give more should be given more (Wenham: 224). Furthermore, later, in Genesis 31, God will refer to the vow without judgment.

Babel reversal: the tops of the tower and the stairway reached the heavens/sky. The people were scattered from the city. God will bring Jacob back.

Jesus recalls this dream in John 1:51. Whatever dark "place" youâ€™re in, Jesus is the way to bring light to it and draw you to God, back to Eden. And whatever dark place you go, you have been empowered to shine light on it and bring Godâ€™s blessing to it to make all the earth Beth-el, the house of God. All humanity is invited into the church, Christâ€™s bride, and to the heavenly banquet (Isaiah 25:1). 

"Despite the complexity of this verse, its allusion to the dream of Jacob in Genesis 28:12 is clear and suggests that Jesus as the Son of Man is the new Bethel..., the new point of contact between earth and heaven." (Engaging with God, 95.)

Differences:

Abram and God have a dialog. Jacob and God's speeches on are one-sided.
Abram believed God. There's nothing about Jacob believing
