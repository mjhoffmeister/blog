**The Jacob Cycle - Part 5**

Essentially exiled, traveling from Beersheba toward Haran, Jacob stops for the night. This scene parallels God speaking to Abraham in Genesis 15 (??) (Sailhamer: 452).

The story is circular/concentric based on keywords and phrases (Wenham: 219):

A: “place” - Gen 28:11  
	B: “stones,” “headrest” (“sleep”) - Gen 28:11  
		C: “heaven/sky, ” (“he dreamed”) - Gen 28:12  
			D: “God” (Elohim) - Gen 28:12   
				E: “The LORD” (Yahweh) - Gen 28:13  
					F: Yahweh’s promises to Jacob - Gen 28:13-15  
				E’: “The LORD” (Yahweh,) (“Jacob awoke”) - Gen 28:16   
			D’: “God”: (Elohim) - Gen 28:17   
		C’: “heaven/sky” - Gen 28:17  
	B’: “stone,” “headrest” - Gen 28:18  
A: “place” - Gen 28:19  

Up to this point, Jacob has only used the name “Yahweh” (in vain) while deceiving Isaac, saying Yahweh’s help was the reason he, while pretending to be Esau, was able to return so quickly from his hunt. Is there significance that Jacob wakes up closer to Yahweh?

Also, Jacob’s vow echo’s God’s promises to him, forming a linear parallel or parallel panels:

1. “place” - Genesis 28:11 | “place” - Genesis 28:16-17
2. “stones,” “headrest”  - Genesis 28:11 | “stone,” “headrest” - Genesis 28:18
3. “I am with you” - Genesis 28:15 | “If God will be with me” - Genesis 28:20
4. “guard you wherever you go” - Genesis 28:15 | “guard me in this way that I go” - Genesis 28:20
5. “bring you back to this land” - Genesis 28:15 | “return to my father’s house” - Genesis 28:21
6. “I will not leave you” - Genesis 28:16 | “The Lord shall be my god” - Genesis 28:21

There are both visual and verbal elements of the dream. I’ll be sharing the interpretation of Yitzak Peleg that they interpret each other rather than the visual aspect merely being a backdrop to God speaking.

Genesis 28:11 - The “place” (maqom) creates a boundary for this section. Jacob first comes upon an unnamed place. At the end of the section, because of what transpires here, the “place” is named (Peleg: 55). The place is first encountered at night, after the sun had set, so it’s first shrouded in darkness.

Literally, Jacob “takes from the stones/one of the stones” to “arrange” a “headrest.” The Hebrew is ambiguous as to whether Jacob takes a single stone or multiple stones. If he took multiple, some could have been placed around his head as a protective barrier. We know that at least one was used as a kind of pillow because of what comes later (Peleg: 57).

Genesis 28:12 - Here Jacob’s dream begins. The phrase “and behold” is used to call attention to a part (one of four) of the dream and link them together (Peleg: 62, 67.) This part of the dream is visual. Jacob sees “angels” (malake, literally “messengers”) going up and down on a stairway connecting earth and heaven. We should probably imagine a stairway or ramp of a ziggurat, recalling the tower of Babel in Genesis 11. In fact, Genesis 11 is the only other place in the Bible describing something reaching the top of the heavens. Could this be a reversal of Babel?

The angels’ movements likely represent the journeys of the patriarchs within the cosmic geography. Abraham is described as going “down” to and “up” from Egypt. Jacob is about to go from the land and God will promise him that he’ll return to it. The words “return” and “go” we see later in God’s promises are linked to “ascend” and “descend” (Peleg: 66). That the angels are described first as ascending could be a link to Abraham first going from Ur into Canaan (Peleg: 111).

The word for “stairway” sullam (used only here in the Bible,) could be connected with the word mesillah, “highway,” which is often used to describe a way back to the promised land from exile. Jeremiah 31:21 expresses this and uses many of the same words or synonyms of words we have in Jacob’s dream story. The stairway represents a connection between heaven and earth and the way back from exile (Peleg: 95-96).

The word for “angels,” malake (mala-KAY) literally means “messengers.” It’s a puzzle that they give no verbal message (Peleg:102).

There’s an Ancient Near East myth with a similar image. In Nergal and Ereshkigal, the gods of heaven are not allowed to descend to the underworld and vice versa:

“We (the gods of Heaven) are forbidden to descend to you (to Sheol) and you (Ereshkigal, queen of Sheol) are forbidden to ascend to us” (Peleg: ??)

Ereshkigal sends Nemtar as a messenger to receive her portion from the feast of the gods.

Nemtar ascended the long sullam of the heavens
Nergal descended the long sullam from the heavens

Nemtar is a messenger for Ereshkigal to request a portion from the feast of the gods. Later, the god Nergal rebelliously descends to the underworld to marry Ereshkigal.

Genesis: 28:13(a) - God is standing above the stairway. There could deliberately be two connotations to this. When God or his angel is described as standing, it can be read in one of two contrasting ways: either as a sentence of doom or the establishment of a covenant. We see this tension in Genesis 18:2 before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham sees three men, somehow recognizing God among them, and prepares a covenant meal after which God promises the birth of Isaac. Following that, God reveals he’s come to judge the cities. This possibility is reinforced by Jacob’s two responses to his dream, that “the Lord is in this place” (Gen 28:16) and “how frightening is this place” (Gen 28:17.)

The “god” of verse 12 reveals himself to be the God of Abraham and Isaac. Abraham is said to be Jacob’s father rather than Isaac. This could be because Jacob is about to experience a kind of exile like Abraham did in Egypt (Peleg: 73). It could also illustrate that the continuity of these promises is due to Abraham’s obedience, not Isaac’s or Jacob’s.

Genesis 28:13-14 - the first part of the promise God gives to Jacob has four elements and is clearly linked to God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:3, 13:14-16.

1. I will give the land to you and your offspring
2. Your offspring will be like the dust of the earth
3. You should spread to the west, east, north, and south
4. In you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed

Isaac’s blessing is confirmed by Yahweh

Genesis 28:15 - the second part of the promise also has four elements surrounding Jacob’s return to the land. While the first part of the promise looks far into the future, the second part regards the nearer term (Fokkelman: 61).

1. I am with you
2. I will guard you
3. I will bring you back to this land
4. I will not leave you until I’ve done what I’ve promised

Yahweh asserts himself to be a god of a particular land and a god that goes with his chosen one into a different land (Peleg 83). He isn’t constrained by the boundary lines of other nations nor challenged by their gods.

Genesis 28:16-19 - Jacob awakes, marking the end of the dream (Peleg: 60.) In the morning (so the place in now in light) Jacob sees clearly. The “place” is the house of God and a gate of heaven. The “stone” is transformed, from pillar to one used in a religious ritual, consecrated by Jacob anointing it with oil (Peleg: 57). It is also a commemoration: the root for pillar, ntsb,  is the same word used to describe the stairway “resting” on the earth and Yahweh “standing” over it. He gives the place an apt name, Beth-el, “house of God,” and the Bible tells us that the name of the (perhaps nearby) city was first named Luz, which means almond tree. (It was named after a fruit tree!)

Genesis 28:20-22 - Jacob’s vow can be seen as an indication of his fledgling faith still being quite weak (Walton: 573). However, Jacob is perhaps deserving of some sympathy. He begins to worship as he knows how according to his cultural setting. He gave what he had, the stone and oil, and promised to give more should be given more (Wenham: 224). Furthermore, later, in Genesis 31, God will refer to the vow without judgment.

Babel reversal: the tops of the tower and the stairway reached the heavens/sky. The people were scattered from the city. God will bring Jacob back.

Jesus recalls this dream in John 1:51. Whatever dark “place” you’re in, Jesus is the way to bring light to it and draw you to God, back to Eden. And whatever dark place you go, you have been empowered to shine light on it and bring God’s blessing to it to make all the earth Beth-el, the house of God. All humanity is invited into the church, Christ’s bride, and to the heavenly banquet (Isaiah 25:1). 

“Despite the complexity of this verse, its allusion to the dream of Jacob in Genesis 28:12 is clear and suggests that Jesus as the Son of Man is the new Bethel..., the new point of contact between earth and heaven.” (Engaging with God, 95.)
