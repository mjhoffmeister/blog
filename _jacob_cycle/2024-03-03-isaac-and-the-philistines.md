**The Jacob Cycle - Part 3**

## Structure

Immediately after considerable action between Jacob and Esau, we get an entire chapter dedicated to 
the life of Isaac as an interruption within the Jacob story. It appears to be chronologically out of
order[^1] and is highly repetitive of episodes of Abraham in Egypt 
([Genesis 12:10-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/12/10-20)) and Gerar 
([Genesis 20:1-18](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/20/1-18).) At surface level, this may seem
incoherent, but the intrusion serves to develop the story of God‘s covenant with the seed of the 
woman, allows us to reflect on what just happened, and frames what will follow.[^2] Also, we‘re 
still to compare this story with that of Abraham, with differences between the two cycles being 
particularly instructive. Furthermore, it‘s linked to the story of Jacob‘s daughter Dinah in 
Genesis 34, which is itself an interruption between chapters 33 and 35 and also deals with 
interactions with the people of Canaan.[^3]

### Sections

The chapter is divided into seven sections which correspond to the seven sections in the stories 
of Abraham in Egypt and Gerar.[^4]

## Divine promises in Gerar

> <sup>1</sup> Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of
Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelek king of the Philistines. <sup>2</sup> And the LORD 
appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you. 
<sup>3</sup> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your
offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your 
father. <sup>4</sup> I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your 
offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, 
<sup>5</sup> because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and 
my laws." <sup>6</sup> So Isaac settled in Gerar.
>
> --Genesis 26:1-6 (ESV)

As noted above, The Jacob Cycle continues to parallel the Abraham Cycle. Genesis 26:1-6 parallels
the beginning of Genesis 12:

> <sup>1</sup> Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go from your country and your kindred and your father‘s
house to the land that I will show you. <sup>2</sup> And I will make of you a great nation, and I
will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. <sup>3</sup> I will bless 
those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the 
earth shall be blessed."
>
> <sup>10</sup> Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, 
for the famine was severe in the land.
>
> --Genesis 12:1-3, 10 (ESV)

As with us, the lived experience of the chosen line stands in contrast with God‘s promise: the land
experiences famine. Genesis 26:1 starts exactly like Genesis 12:10, but we‘re told that this is a 
different famine than the one Abraham experiences.[^5] Isaac goes to Gerar, like Abraham did, and as
before the king of that place is a man named Abimelek. Abimelek means "my father is king," so it 
could be a title of the ruler of Gerar. We don't need to assume that this Abimelek is the same one 
encountered by Abraham. Rather, the name serves as a link between Abraham and Isaac to prompt 
questions for us. Will Isaac leave the land like Abraham did? Will he pass Rebekah off as his 
sister?[^6]

### The Philistines

The Philistines weren‘t a presence in Canaan until later in history (1200 B.C.)[^7] In Judges and 
Samuel, they're are portrayed as violent invaders rather than the relatively peaceful people we see
in Genesis, and lived in the "pentapolis," not Gerar.[^8] So, why identify Abimelek and Gerar with 
the Philistines?

Historically, "Philistines" could have been applied to an earlier group (perhaps the Caphtorim of 
[Deuteronomy 2:23](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/deuteronomy/2/23)) which settled in Gerar and only 
later expanded to occupy the Canaanite coast.[^9] Beyond that, maybe there‘s a narrative purpose 
behind using "Philistines." What other other nation has been called out that would in the future be
in conflict with Israel? Edom. So, perhaps Abimelek and Philistia are intended to serve as analogies
to Esau and Edom in Genesis 26.

### Divine intervention

> <sup>2</sup> And the LORD appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of 
which I shall tell you.
>
> --Genesis 26:2 (ESV)

> <sup>10</sup> Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, 
for the famine was severe in the land.
>
> --Genesis 12:10 (ESV)

We learn that Isaac was traveling to Egypt, as Abraham did during the famine in his time. However, 
God instructs him to stay in the land ([Genesis 10:19](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/10/19) 
states that Gerar was on the border of the settled land of Canaan.)[^10] This casts more light on
Abraham‘s actions. The famine was a test for him, which he failed. Rather than trusting God to 
provide in the land, he left to search out what he needed on his own. While God‘s instruction stops
Isaac from following through with going to Egypt, we see his spiritual condition is similar to his 
father‘s when faced with the same test. However, we‘ll see that the danger he encounters is less
pronounced than it was for Abraham in Egypt and Gerar.[^11]

### Promise of blessing

> <sup>3</sup> Sojourn in this land, and [1] I will be with you and [2] will bless you, for [3] to 
you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and [4] I will establish the oath that I 
swore to Abraham your father. <sup>4</sup> [5] I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven
[6] and will give to your offspring all these lands. And [7] in your offspring all the nations of 
the earth shall be blessed, <sup>5</sup> because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my 
commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
>
> --Genesis 26:3-5 (ESV) [emphasis added]

> <sup>2</sup> And [1] I will make of you a great nation, and [2] I will bless you and [3] make your
name great, so that [4] you will be a blessing. <sup>3</sup> [5] I will bless those who bless you, 
and [6] him who dishonors you I will curse, and [7] in you all the families of the earth shall be
blessed."
>
> --Genesis 12:2-3 (ESV) [emphasis added]

While Abraham's blessing in Genesis 12 is linked to Isaac's in Genesis 26 through the parallelism 
established between the Abraham and Jacob cycles, Isaac's blessing also contains elements of God's
reiterated blessing to Abraham after he was commanded to sacrifice Isaac.

> <sup>16</sup> ... "By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this
and have not withheld your son, your only son, <sup>17</sup> I will surely bless you, and I will 
surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. 
And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, <sup>18</sup> and in your offspring shall
all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."
>
> --Genesis 22:16b-18 (ESV)

The differences between Abraham's and Isaac's blessings emphasize the themes of the Jacob Cycle. 

#### I will be with you

Abraham's blessings don't include the promise that God will be with him. This doesn't mean that the 
Bible is saying that God wasn't with Abraham; rather, it reveals that whether God will be with 
Jacob (and Isaac, here in chapter 26) is a central question that the story will answer.

God repeats this promise to Jacob later in the story at Bethel 
([Genesis 28:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/15),) and Jacob makes God being with him 
part of the condition for him pledging allegiance to Yahweh 
([Genesis 28:20-22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/20-22).) More will be discussed about 
the contractual nature of this exchange later, but it reinforces the idea that Jacob, at least, 
has no assumption about God being with him wherever he goes.

#### Your offspring shall posses the gate of his enemies

In the blessing given to Abraham in Genesis 22, it's promised that a descendant will "possess the
gates of his enemies." This militaristic language has been omitted from Isaac's blessing, perhaps 
foreshadowing Isaac's passive nature in Genesis 26.[^12] Furthermore, the absence of "possess the 
gates" could be set in contrast to "city gate" (*sa‘ar ‘ir*) appearing three times in Genesis 34, 
the parallel chapter to Genesis 26. There, Jacob, too, is passive, but to the detriment of his 
family and their standing in the land. God must intervene to prevent them from overtaking Jacob's 
camp ([Genesis 35:5](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/35/5).) In Isaac's case, not "possessing 
the gate of his enemies" is portrayed as a good thing leading to peace and prosperity, where Jacob's
passivity in Genesis 34 inspires his sons to attack and pillage a Hivite city. While the narrative 
doesn't outright condone the behavior of Jacob's sons, it does seem to be critical of Jacob. 
Ecclesiastes 3:8 may provide a succinct summary of the comparison between Genesis 26 and 34.

> A time for war, and a time for peace.
>
> --Ecclesiastes 3:8b (ESV)

It's worth noting that the promise of a descendant of Abraham possessing the gate of his enemies is
messianic. It's ultimate fulfillment is found through Jesus. Paul references Genesis 22:18 (which
follows the gate possession verse) in Galatians 3:16.[^13]

> <sup>16</sup> Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, "And to
offsprings," referring to many, but referring to one, "And to your offspring," who is Christ.
> 
> --Galatians 3:16 (ESV)

Jesus may have had the promise of Abraham's descendant possessing the gate of his enemies in mind 
when he declared that the gates of Hades won't withstand the assault of his church.[^14]

> <sup>18</sup> "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the 
gates of hell [literally Hades] shall not prevail against it."
>
> --Matthew 16:18 (ESV)

The true enemies of humanity are the rebel spiritual forces and death itself.

> <sup>24</sup> Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying
every rule and every authority and power. <sup>25</sup> For he must reign until he has put all his 
enemies under his feet. <sup>26</sup> The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
>
> --1 Corinthians 15:24-26 (ESV)

It's significant that the first time the promise of Abraham's descendant possessing the gate of his
enemies is given is after the Isaac sacrifice episode. Isaac was saved from death by God providing 
a substitute. Jesus saves us from death, the final enemy, by being our substitute.

#### Abraham obeyed

God tells Isaac that the promise of blessing isn't contingent on anything Isaac has done or will do.
It's based on Abraham's obedience to God.[^15] As noted in 
[Part 1](overview.html#the-source-of-blessing), the source of blessing is a major theme in the 
Jacob Cycle. Here, we have an early indication that blessing is not something the characters in the 
story need to strive for; it's given as a gift.

#### Charge, commandments, statute, and laws

Elaborating on Abraham's obedience, God states that Abraham kept his charge, commandments, statutes, 
and laws. This is almost the exact wording of Deuteronomy 11:1 where Moses expresses what God 
requires of Israel after he received the second set of tablets that had the ten commandments.
(The first set he broke after speaking to God on Mount Sinai and seeing the people worshipping a 
golden calf in [Exodus 32:19](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/exodus/32/19).)

> <sup>19</sup> "You shall therefore love the LORD your God and keep his charge, his statutes, his 
rules, and his commandments always."
>
> --Deuteronomy 11:1 (ESV)

The Sinai covenant hadn't been established in Isaac's time, so what does this mean? Abraham lived by
faith in God, and therefore he followed the wisdom behind the law. Following the law wasn‘t intended
as an end unto itself. Rather, it formed Israel as a distinct people marked by their relationship
to Yahweh.[^16] We find the laws evolve as Israel‘s situation changes from wandering to living in
the land. For example, laws are established about moving boundary stones in 
[Deuteronomy 19:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Deuteronomy/19/14). Such a law doesn't apply to a 
nomadic context, but the root virtue of honesty was consistent throughout Israel's history.

Yahweh claimed Abraham's family as his and Abraham's obedience to the heart of God's law set him 
apart as God's own. So, Isaac, as Abraham's son, receives the blessing first given to Abraham.

This is in contrast to how Jacob obtained the birthright.[^17] Isaac receives the promises on God‘s
terms: as a free gift based on his father‘s obedience, not by scheming as Jacob did.[^18]

### Isaac obeys

> <sup>6</sup> So Isaac settled in Gerar.
>
> --Genesis 26:6 (ESV)

Isaac obeys God and doesn't proceed to Egypt. 

## Wife/sister

In Gerar, Isaac shows that he doesn't fully trust God as protector. He resorts to the same
deception as his father did to protect himself from the perceived danger of having a beautiful 
wife among the nations.

### Perceived threat and deception

> <sup>7</sup> When the men of the place asked him about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," for
he feared to say, "My wife," thinking, "lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah,
" because she was attractive in appearance.
>
> --Genesis 26:7 (ESV)

This is the last of three incidents in Genesis where a patriarch pretends that his wife is only his
sister (see [Abraham in Egypt](#parallels-with-abraham-in-egypt) and 
[Abraham in Gerar](#parallels-with-abraham-in-gerar).) As mentioned above, the danger God's chosen 
line faces is progressively less pronounced in each of these episodes. Pharaoh took Sarai as his
wife in Genesis 12 (see [Genesis 12:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/12/15) and 
[Genesis 12:19](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/12/19).) In Genesis 20, Abimelek took Sarah, 
but God prevented him from touching her ([Genesis 20:6](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/20/6).)
In Genesis 26, we'll see that Rebekah isn't taken at all.

[Part 1](overview.html#historical-context) introduced the idea of exile being a theme explored in 
the Jacob Cycle, partly by holding multiple historical exiles in tensions. Taken together, the 
wife/sister scenes work as an oracle for Israel being enslaved by Egypt and the Exodus.[^19] While 
the foreshadowing of enslavement by Egypt solidifies into an inevitability in Genesis, it's also 
preluded by the establishment of God's protection and plan for humanity's rescue as unshakable. The 
decreasing danger in the wife/sister scenes, all pointing to Egypt, show that God's plan to bring 
humanity back to Eden is never truly threatened, even when Israel is enslaved. That message 
reverberates forward to the Babylonian exile, Jesus's "exile" on the cross, and our own communal and
personal spiritual exiles.

Immediately in the context of the Jacob Cycle, this scene reflects back on what has happened with 
the birthright and what will soon follow with the blessing.

### Threat disproved

> <sup>8</sup> When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a
window and saw Isaac laughing with Rebekah his wife.
>
> --Genesis 26:8 (ESV)

Isaac and Rebekah stay in Gerar "a long time" without anyone trying to take Rebekah, revealing that
the perceived threat was unfounded and the ruse wasn't necessary. Isaac stayed in Gerar instead of
going to Egypt in obedience to God and he was protected there.

Throughout Genesis, a formula is established that indicates when a boundary is on the verge of being
crossed. "See" (root *r‘h*,) "good" (*tov*,) and "take" (root *lqh*) are common words used in the 
formula. The first time they're used in this way is in the garden of Eden when Eve is tempted to eat
the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

> <sup>6</sup> So when the woman saw [*tere‘*, root *r‘h*] that the tree was good [*tov*] for 
food...she took [*tiqqah*, root *lqh*] of its fruit and ate...
>
> Genesis 3:6 (ESV)

The boundary here is the eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve "sees" 
the "good" fruit on the other side of the boundary and crosses it when she "takes" the fruit.

We see this pattern again in Genesis 6.

> <sup>1</sup> When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, 
<sup>2</sup> the sons of God saw [*yir‘u*, root *r‘h*] that the daughters of man were attractive 
[*tovot*, the feminine plural form of *tov*]. And they took [*yiqhu*, root *lqh*] as their wives any
they chose.
>
> --Genesis 6:1-2 (ESV)

The "sons of god" are spiritual beings.[^20] There are various interpretations of their actions in 
Genesis 6, but those actions should be seen as against God's will.[^21] The boundary for the sons of
God is marrying humans. They "see" the "good" daughters of man/human and cross the boundary when
they "take" wives for themselves.

In Genesis 12 and 20, Sarai/Sarah is "taken" for/by Pharaoh and Abimelek. (She's "seen" by
Pharaoh's officials in [Genesis 12:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/12/15), but,
interestingly, the only "seeing" done in Genesis 20 is by Abraham in an accusation by Abimelek in 
[verse 10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/20/10), perhaps working as a kind of reversal to 
emphasize Abraham's culpability.)

In Genesis 26:7, Isaac's justification for the ruse is that Rebekah is "attractive (*tov*) in 
appearance (*mar‘eh*, root *r‘h*.)" He fears he'll be killed so that the Philistines can take her.
In this episode, what's seen by Abimelek isn't only something good to be desired, but the truth of
the situation. He sees Isaac "laughing" with his wife, a euphemism for physical intimacy employed 
to create a play on words between "Isaac" and "laughing." In Genesis
[Genesis 17:19](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/17/19), God instructs Abraham to name his 
future son Isaac after Abraham laughed when God foretold the birth of a son in Abraham and
Sarah's old age (Sarah, too, laughs at the prospect in 
[Genesis 18:12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/18/12)). Isaac (*yitskhaq*) and "laughing"
(*m<sup>e</sup>tsakheq*) share the same root word in Hebrew (*ts-kh-q*.) In a sense, Isaac is 
"Isaac-ing" Rebekah. Jacob will later "Jacob" Esau (Jacob, [*ya‘aqov*,] sounds like *‘aqov*, "to 
cheat, seize someone by the heel") by disguising himself as Esau.[^22] As deception wasn't needed in
Isaac's situation, it wasn't needed in Jacob's. Abimelek recognizes the boundary and doesn't cross
it.

Play on Isaac's name is also present in the parallel section in the Abraham Cycle which includes the
birth of Isaac and and the sending away of Hagar and Ishmael.

> <sup>6</sup> And Sarah said, “God has made **laughter** for me; everyone who hears will **laugh**
over me.”
>
> <sup>9 </sup> But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, 
**laughing**.
>
> Genesis 21:5, 9 (ESV) [emphasis added]

Isaac's birth transformed Abraham and Sarah's incredulous laughter into joyful laughter. Shortly 
thereafter in the narrative, Ishmael is "laughing" with Isaac, which carries the sense of "mocking"
or "making fun of."[^23] Ishmael's "Isaac-ing" of Isaac serves as a catalyst for his and his 
mother's exile, while Isaac remains in the land. Isaac will now experience a reversal: after lying 
to the Philistines and being discovered through his own "Isaac-ing," he'll be the one sent away.

### Outrage

> <sup>9</sup> So Abimelech called Isaac and said, "Behold, she is your wife. How then could you 
say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac said to him, "Because I thought, 'Lest I die because of her.'" 
<sup>10</sup> Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have
lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us." <sup>11</sup> So Abimelech warned 
all the people, saying, "Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
>
> --Genesis 26:8-11 (ESV)

Abimelek was angry about Isaac's deception because of the danger it posed to his people. We're to 
recall the consequences of Pharaoh taking Sarah: plagues were inflicted on him and his house 
([Genesis 12:17](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/12/17).) Here, Abimelek's integrity is seen
through his actions, but, in the parallel episode in Genesis 20, it's made more explicit with 
vocabulary that creates an interesting contrast with Jacob. When Abraham was in Gerar, Abimelek
responds to God's warning in a dream that he took Sarah in the "integrity of [his] heart"
([Genesis 20:6](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/20/6).)
"Integrity" is the Hebrew word *tam*, the same word used to describe Jacob in
[Genesis 25:27](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/27). Abimelek is shown to be more righteous
than Isaac, the chosen seed of the woman, and set in contrast to Jacob, who is ironically described
as *tam* before swindling the birthright away from Esau.

### Shall surely die

Abimelek's threat to kill anyone who touches Isaac or Rebekah is an echo from Eden and Abraham's 
time in Gerar.

> <sup>6</sup> "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day 
that you eat of it you shall surely die [*mot tamut*]."
>
> --Genesis 2:17 (ESV)

> <sup>7</sup> Now then, return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, 
and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die [*mot tamut*], you
and all who are yours.”
>
> Genesis 20:7 (ESV)

Literally, the consequence of not obeying the commands in Genesis 2:17 (and 3:4,) 20:7, and 26:11 is
that the offenders will "die die." The verb "die" (root *mwt*) is repeated for emphasis, hence the
translation "surely die" in the ESV. In Genesis 2 and 20, God is the judge who sets the sentence for
crossing the boundary; in Genesis 26, it's Abimelek. A king of the nations is being shown to be more
righteous than the chosen child of promise.

In [Part 2](beginnings.html#rebekahs-barrenness), it was suggested that the barrenness of the 
matriarchs illustrates that it's not by human effort that the chosen line will continue, it's by 
God's grace. Abimelek being portrayed as being a person of higher character than Isaac perhaps adds 
to this. The chosen line can't perpetuate or lose their status through their actions. Later in the 
chapter, we'll see that blessing flows through Isaac to Abimelek, even though Abimelek is depicted 
in a more favorable light.

## Response to flourishing

### Blessing

> <sup>12</sup> And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The LORD 
blessed him, <sup>13</sup> and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very 
wealthy. <sup>14</sup> He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the 
Philistines envied him. <sup>15</sup> (Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the
wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.)
>
> --Genesis 26:12-15 (ESV)

Famine is experienced by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob 
([Genesis 41:53-54](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/41/53-54),) but Isaac is the only patriarch
who stays in the land during one. Abraham and Jacob’s family settle in Egypt. Isaac, staying in the
land, plants a crop that yields an exceptionally bountiful harvest despite the famine. Furthermore, 
Isaac attains wealth through livestock and servants. So, we see God's promise of blessing 
materializing.[^24] We also learn more of what is at stake for the son who has the birthright. The 
right of the firstborn confers a double portion of Isaac's wealth, so whoever holds it stands to 
receive two-thirds of the wealth accumulated by Isaac.

### Exodus

> <sup>16</sup> And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.” 
<sup>17</sup> So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.
>
> --Genesis 26:16-17 (ESV)

Isaac's wealth leads to the Philistines envying him and we’re given a note about the Philistines
spitefully filling Abraham’s wells. When Abraham was in Gerar, the servants of the Abimelek of his
time seized one of his wells, but a treaty was made between Abraham and Abimelek and the well was
returned ([Genesis 21:25-34](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/21/25-34).) This treaty was either
ignored or forgotten, and Isaac passively acquiesces to Abimelek’s request to “go away” from them
because he had become “mightier” than they were. These phrases are a link to passages in 
Exodus.[^25]

> <sup>16</sup> And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much [*m<sup>e</sup>'od*]
mightier [*'atsam<sup>e</sup>ta*, root *'-ts-m*] than we.”
>
> --Genesis 26:16 (ESV)

As a precursor to Pharaoh fearing the Israelites' strength, their flourishing is described with 
language from the Genesis 1 commission ([Genesis 1:28](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/1/28))
and Abimelek's concern.

> But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly
[*m<sup>e</sup>'od* *m<sup>e</sup>'od* (repeated for emphasis)] strong [*ya'astmu*, root *'-ts-m*],
so that the land was filled with them.
>
> --Exodus 1:7 (ESV)

At the beginning of Exodus, we see again the nations fearing God's people because of their strength.
The response of Abimelek stands in stark contrast to Pharaoh's. He asks Isaac to "go away from us"
(*lek me‘im anu*.) Pharaoh and the Egyptians, instead, "set taskmasters over them to afflict them 
with heavy burdens" (Exodus 1:11.) It isn't until 9 plagues have been inflicted on Egypt that 
Pharaoh says to Moses "get away from me" (*lek me‘al ay*,) and after the Israelites depart, he 
pursues them ([Exodus 14:5-9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/exodus/14/5-9).)

The link to Exodus is further strengthened by the word "encamped" (*yihan*.) It's a rare word in 
Genesis, used only here and in the transition leading into Genesis 34 
([Genesis 33:18](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/33/18),) the parallel chapter to Genesis 26. 
It's extensively used in Exodus and elsewhere to describe the Israelites camping in the wilderness.
[^26]

A likely reason for these link is to foreshadow what'ss to come for God's people. We might also be
expected to compare Isaac's "exodus" with Israel's. How do different leaders of the nations respond
to the strength of God's chosen line and what are their fates?

### Parallels with the Abraham Cycle

#### Abram and Lot

This section is thematically parallel with Abram and Lot separating in 
[Genesis 13:1-13](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/13/1-13). Abram had also become wealthy, and
the land couldn't support him and Lot.

> <sup>2</sup> Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. <sup>3</sup> And he 
journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
between Bethel and Ai, <sup>4</sup> to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there
Abram called upon the name of the LORD. <sup>5</sup> And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks 
and herds and tents, <sup>6</sup> so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together;
for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, <sup>7</sup> and there was
strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock.
>
> <sup>8</sup> Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your 
herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. <sup>9</sup> Is not the whole land before you? 
Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take 
the right hand, then I will go to the left.” <sup>10</sup> And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that 
the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD....<sup>11</sup> So Lot 
chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each 
other.

>
> --Genesis 13:2-7a, 8-10a, 11 (ESV)

The strain led to conflict between Abram and Lot's herdsmen, so they decided to separate. As the 
elder and Lot's uncle (and possibly guardian), Abram had the right to choose the best land
for himself.[^27] However, he allows Lot to choose the more attractive land.



#### Hagar and Ishmael

As introduced [above](#threat-disproved), there are also links to Abraham sending Hagar and Ishmael
away in Genesis 21. Hagar "departed" (*telek*, root *hlk*) to the wilderness of Beersheba after 
being sent away with Ishmael by Abraham 
([Genesis 13:1-13](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/13/1-13).) Isaac departed (*yelek*, root 
*hlk*) to the Valley of Gerar after being asked to go by Abimelek. With the continued linking of the
two stories through shared words, the invitation to compare them is strengthened. The ramifications
on interpretation are discussed below.

## Isaac's wells


Genesis 26:18-20 - Isaac restores the wells dug by Abraham and gives them their original names, which may have established clear ownership rights (Sarna: 186). While doing this, Isaac’s servants discover another well, but the shepherds of Gerar unjustly say it’s theirs. Instead of challenging them, he calls the well Esek and leaves it to them. 

There are links back to Abraham and Lot separating in Genesis 13:5-7, continuing the link to the Abraham’s story which began in Genesis 25:19/Genesis 11:27.

Genesis 13:7 - There was quarreling (riv) between the herdsman (ro’e) of Abram’s livestock and the herdsman (ro’e) of Lot’s livestock.

Genesis 26:20 - The herdsmen of Gerar (ro’e) quarreled (yarivbu - note the root riv) with Isaac’s herdsmen (ro’e).

Abraham didn’t insist on the best land for himself; he let Lot choose. Isaac didn’t take the well by force, instead letting the Gerar herdsmen have it.

Genesis 26:21-22 - Another well is dug, but the Gerar herdsman unjustly claim that one, too. Isaac names the well Sitnah and moves on again. A third well is dug, there’s no dispute, and Isaac calls it Rehoboth. His statement is an echo of Eden (Sailhamer: 436):

Genesis 26:22 - “We shall be fruitful (parinu, root: prh) in the land (arets).”
Genesis 1:28 - “Be fruitful (peru, root: prh) 

What’s the point of these well episodes being in the Jacob story?

The first well is named Esek. The word Esek isn’t used anywhere else in the Bible, but it literally means “contention” and in other sources it’s used in connection to disputed titles of ownership (Sarna: 186). Have we seen contention over something similar to a title of ownership? Yes - Jacob coercing Esau into selling his birthright over a bowl of lentil soup (Walton: 559).

The second well is named Sitnah, which means “hostility” and is used in Ezra 4:6 to indicate a formal accusation against someone (Sarna: 186). This is connected to Esau later lodging a complaint against Jacob for cheating him out of the blessing in Genesis 27:36 (Walton: 559).

The third well, named Rehoboth, which means “wide open spaces” (Sailhamer: 436), points to the parting between Jacob and Esau resolving their conflict (Walton: 559).

So, the story of these wells gives us hope that God can work through difficult situations and imperfect people to accomplish his plan. It also casts light on Jacob’s actions. His “taking” wasn’t required. Even though Esau had the cultural right of the firstborn, God had chosen Jacob. He would have blessed Jacob freely with no need for scheming and deception.




## Isaac and Abimelek make peace

There's great contrast between the fates of the leaders of the nations, as well. Abimelek confesses 
that Isaac, Yahweh's chosen is blessed by Yahweh and enjoys a covenant feast with Isaac in 
Eden-space (see [Isaac and Abimelek make peace](#isaac-and-abimelek-make-peace) below,) while 
Pharaoh, who refuses to listen to Moses, Yahweh's chosen, and his army are consumed by the waters 
of the Sea of Reeds.
