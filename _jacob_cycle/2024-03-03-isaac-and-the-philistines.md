**The Jacob Cycle - Part 3**

## Structure

Immediately after considerable action between Jacob and Esau, we get an entire chapter dedicated to 
the life of Isaac as an interruption within the Jacob story. It appears to be chronologically out of
order[^1] and is highly repetitive of episodes of Abraham in Egypt 
([Genesis 12:10-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/12/10-20)) and Gerar 
([Genesis 20:1-18](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/20/1-18).) At surface level, this may seem
incoherent, but the intrusion serves to develop the story of God’s covenant with the seed of the 
woman, allows us to reflect on what just happened, and frames what will follow.[^2] Also, we’re 
still to compare this story with that of Abraham, with differences between the two cycles being 
particularly instructive. Furthermore, it’s linked to the story of Jacob’s daughter Dinah in 
Genesis 34, which is itself an interruption between chapters 33 and 35 and also deals with 
interactions with the people of Canaan.[^3]

### Sections

The chapter is divided into seven sections which correspond to the seven sections in the stories 
of Abraham in Egypt and Gerar.[^4]

## Divine promises in Gerar

> <sup>1</sup> Now there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that was in the days of
Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to Abimelech king of the Philistines. <sup>2</sup> And the LORD 
appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you. 
<sup>3</sup> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you, for to you and to your
offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath that I swore to Abraham your 
father. <sup>4</sup> I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your 
offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, 
<sup>5</sup> because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and 
my laws.” <sup>6</sup> So Isaac settled in Gerar.
>
> --Genesis 26:1-6 (ESV)

As noted above, The Jacob Cycle continues to parallel the Abraham Cycle. Genesis 26:1-6 parallels
the beginning of Genesis 12:

> <sup>1</sup> Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s
house to the land that I will show you. <sup>2</sup> And I will make of you a great nation, and I
will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. <sup>3</sup> I will bless 
those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the 
earth shall be blessed.”
>
> <sup>10</sup> Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, 
for the famine was severe in the land.
>
> --Genesis 12:1-3, 10 (ESV)

As with us, the lived experience of the chosen line stands in contrast with God’s promise: the land
experiences famine. Genesis 26:1 starts exactly like Genesis 12:10, but we’re told that this is a 
different famine than the one Abraham experiences.[^5] Isaac goes to Gerar, like Abraham did, and as
before the king of that place is a man named Abimelek. Abimelek means "my father is king," so it 
could be a title of the ruler of Gerar. We don't need to assume that this Abimelek is the same one 
encountered by Abraham. Rather, the name serves as a link between Abraham and Isaac to prompt 
questions for us. Will Isaac leave the land like Abraham did? Will he pass Rebekah off as his 
sister?[^6]

### The Philistines

The Philistines weren’t a presence in Canaan until later in history (1200 B.C.)[^7] In Judges and 
Samuel, they're are portrayed as violent invaders rather than the relatively peaceful people we see
in Genesis, and lived in the “pentapolis,” not Gerar.[^8] So, why identify Abimelek and Gerar with 
the Philistines?

Historically, “Philistines” could have been applied to an earlier group (perhaps the Caphtorim of 
[Deuteronomy 2:23](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/deuteronomy/2/23)) which settled in Gerar and only 
later expanded to occupy the Canaanite coast.[^9] Beyond that, maybe there’s a narrative purpose 
behind using “Philistines.” What other other nation has been called out that would in the future be
in conflict with Israel? Edom. So, perhaps Abimelek and Philistia are intended to serve as analogies
to Esau and Edom in Genesis 26.

### Divine intervention

> <sup>2</sup> And the LORD appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of 
which I shall tell you.
>
> --Genesis 26:2 (ESV)

> <sup>10</sup> Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, 
for the famine was severe in the land.
>
> --Genesis 12:10 (ESV)

We learn that Isaac was traveling to Egypt, as Abraham did during the famine in his time. However, 
God instructs him to stay in the land ([Genesis 10:19](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/10/19) 
states that Gerar was on the border of the settled land of Canaan.)[^10] This casts more light on
Abraham’s actions. The famine was a test for him, which he failed. Rather than trusting God to 
provide in the land, he left to search out what he needed on his own. While God’s instruction stops
Isaac from following through with going to Egypt, we see his spiritual condition is similar to his 
father’s when faced with the same test. However, we’ll see that the danger he encounters is less
pronounced than it was for Abraham in Egypt and Gerar.[^11]

### Blessing

> <sup>3</sup> Sojourn in this land, and [1] I will be with you and [2] will bless you, for [2] to 
you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and [4] I will establish the oath that I 
swore to Abraham your father. <sup>4</sup> [5] I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven
[6] and will give to your offspring all these lands. And [7] in your offspring all the nations of 
the earth shall be blessed, <sup>5</sup> because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my 
commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”
>
> --Genesis 26:3-5 (ESV) [emphasis added]

> <sup>2</sup> And [1] I will make of you a great nation, and [2] I will bless you and [3] make your
name great, so that [4] you will be a blessing. <sup>3</sup> [5] I will bless those who bless you, 
and [6] him who dishonors you I will curse, and [7] in you all the families of the earth shall be
blessed.”
>
> --Genesis 12:2-3 (ESV) [emphasis added]

While Abraham's blessing in Genesis 12 is linked to Isaac's in Genesis 26 through the parallelism 
established between the Abraham and Jacob cycles, Isaac's blessing also contains elements of God's
reiterated blessing to Abraham after he was commanded to sacrifice Isaac.

> <sup>16</sup> ... “By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this
and have not withheld your son, your only son, <sup>17</sup> I will surely bless you, and I will 
surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. 
And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, <sup>18</sup> and in your offspring shall
all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.”
>
> --Genesis 22:16b-18 (ESV)

The differences between Abraham's and Isaac's blessings emphasize the themes of the Jacob Cycle. 

#### I will be with you

Abraham's blessings don't include the promise that God will be with him. This doesn't mean that the 
Bible is saying that God wasn't with Abraham; rather, it reveals that whether God will be with 
Jacob (and Isaac, here in chapter 26) is a central question that the story will answer.

God repeats this promise to Jacob later in the story at Bethel 
([Genesis 28:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/15),) and Jacob makes God being with him 
part of the condition for him pledging allegiance to Yahweh 
([Genesis 28:20-22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/20-22).) More will be discussed about 
the contractual nature of this exchange later, but it reinforces the idea that Jacob, at least, 
has no assumption about God being with him wherever he goes.

#### Your offspring shall posses the gate of his enemies

In the blessing given to Abraham in Genesis 22, it's promised that a descendant will "possess the
gates of his enemies." This militaristic language has been omitted from Isaac's blessing, perhaps 
foreshadowing Isaac's passive nature in Genesis 26.[^12] Furthermore, the absence of "possess the 
gates" could be set in contrast to "city gate" (*sa‘ar ‘ir*) appearing three times in Genesis 34, 
the parallel chapter to Genesis 26. There, Jacob, too, is passive, but to the detriment of his 
family and their standing in the land. God must intervene to prevent them from overtaking Jacob's 
camp ([Genesis 35:5](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/35/5).) In Isaac's case, not "possessing 
the gate of his enemies" is portrayed as a good thing leading to peace and prosperity, where Jacob's
passivity in Genesis 34 inspires his sons to attack and pillage a Hivite city. While the narrative 
doesn't outright condone the behavior of Jacob's sons, it does seem to be critical of Jacob. 
Ecclesiastes 3:8 may provide a succinct summary of the comparison between Genesis 26 and 34.

> A time for war, and a time for peace.
>
> Ecclesiastes 3:8b (ESV)

It's worth noting that the promise of a descendant of Abraham possessing the gate of his enemies is
messianic. It's ultimate fulfillment is found through Jesus. Paul references Genesis 22:18 (which
follows the gate possession verse) in Galatians 3:16.[^13]

> <sup>16</sup> Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to
offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ.
> 
> Galatians 3:16 (ESV)

Jesus may have had the promise of Abraham's descendant possessing the gate of his enemies in mind 
when he declared that the gates of Hades won't withstand the assault of his church.[^14]

> <sup>18</sup> "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the 
gates of hell [literally Hades] shall not prevail against it."
>
> Matthew 16:18 (ESV)

The true enemies of humanity are the rebel spiritual forces and death itself.

> <sup>24</sup> Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying
every rule and every authority and power. <sup>25</sup> For he must reign until he has put all his 
enemies under his feet. <sup>26</sup> The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
>
> 1 Corinthians 15:24-26 (ESV)

It's significant that the first time the promise of Abraham's descendant possessing the gate of his
enemies is given is after the Isaac sacrifice episode. Isaac was saved from death by God providing 
a substitute. Jesus saves us from death, the final enemy, by being our substitute.

#### Abraham obeyed

God tells Isaac that the promise of blessing isn't contingent on anything Isaac has done or will do.
It's based on Abraham's obedience to God.[^15] As noted in 
[Part 1](overview.html#the-source-of-blessing), the source of blessing is a major theme in the 
Jacob Cycle. Here, we have an early indication that blessing is not something the characters in the 
story need to strive for; it's given as a gift.

#### Charge, commandments, statute, and laws

Elaborating on Abraham's obedience, God states tha Abraham kept his charge, commandments, statutes, 
and laws. This is almost the exact wording of Deuteronomy 11:1 where Moses expresses what God 
requires of Israel after he received the second set of tablets that had the ten commandments.
(The first set he broke after speaking to God on Mount Sinai and seeing the people worshipping a 
golden calf in [Exodus 32:19](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/exodus/32/19).)

> <sup>19</sup> "You shall therefore love the LORD your God and keep his charge, his statutes, his 
rules, and his commandments always."
>
> Deuteronomy 11:1 (ESV)

The Sinai covenant hadn't been established in Isaac's time, so what does this mean? Abraham lived by
faith in God, and therefore he followed the wisdom behind the law. Following the law wasn’t intended
as an end unto itself. Rather, it formed Israel as a distinct people marked by their relationship
to Yahweh.[^16] We find the laws evolve as Israel’s situation changes from wandering to living in
the land. For example, laws are established about moving boundary stones in 
[Deuteronomy 19:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Deuteronomy/19/14). Such a law doesn't apply to a 
nomadic context, but the root virtue of honesty was consistent throughout Israel's history.

Yahweh claimed Abraham's family as his and Abraham's obedience to the heart of God's law set him 
apart as God's own. So, Isaac, as Abraham's son, receives the blessing first given to Abraham.
