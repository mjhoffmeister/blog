**The Jacob Cycle - Part 3**

## Structure

Immediately after considerable action between Jacob and Esau, we get an entire chapter dedicated to 
the life of Isaac as an interruption within the Jacob story. It appears to be chronologically out of
order[^1] and is highly repetitive of episodes of Abraham in Egypt 
([Genesis 12:10-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/12/10-20)) and Gerar 
([Genesis 20:1-18](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/20/1-18).) At surface level, this may seem
incoherent, but the intrusion of the story serves to develop the story of God’s covenant with the 
seed of the woman, allows us to reflect on what just happened, and frames what will follow.[^2]
Also, we’re still to compare this story with that of Abraham, with differences between the two 
cycles being particularly instructive. Furthermore, it’s linked to the story of Jacob’s daughter 
Dinah in Genesis 34, which is an interruption between chapters 33 and 35 and also deals with 
interactions with the people of Canaan.[^3]

### Sections

The chapter is divided into seven sections which correspond to the seven sections in the stories 
of Abraham in Egypt and Gerar.[^4]
