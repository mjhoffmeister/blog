**The Jacob Cycle - Part 1**

The part of the Bible where Jacob is largely the main character is called the "Jacob Cycle" in 
Biblical scholarship. It's a series of stories recorded in Genesis 25-36 that revolve around the 
life of Jacob, the son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the grandson of Abraham and Sarah. This post 
explores the Biblical context of these stories and touches on their overarching structure.

## Context in Genesis

Before Adam and Eve are exiled from the garden of Eden, God foretells of the conflict between the 
seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman. Although there would be a struggle, the seed of the 
woman would ultimately win. Who the seeds of the serpent and woman are isn’t revealed (the serpent, 
walking and talking, seemed a lot like a human, after all;) the rest of the Bible tells the story.
[^1]

The seed of the woman is the image bearer of God and carries the blessed commission to be fruitful 
and multiply and rule over creation. Genesis compares and contrasts this chosen seed and the seed 
of the snake in sections bounded by the phrase “These are the generations.”[^2].

### "These are the generations"

The phrase “these are the the generations” occurs 11 times in Genesis, 10 of which introduce a 
family story or genealogy. The Hebrew word translated "generations" (ESV) is *toledot*. These 
*toledot* units are linked into larger groupings by the word "and" (Hebrew *waw*.)[^3] Many 
English Bible translations hide the "and."

      <td>Jacob</td>
      <td>Genesis 37:2-50:26</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

While this isn't the only way to view the structure of Genesis, it's helpful for understanding the
the context of The Jacob Cycle in the book. The life of Jacob is narrated in the *toledot* of 
Isaac, which is within a larger *toledot* chain whose theme is the sustained hope of God rescuing 
humanity through Abraham's family, descended from Shem, called from Ur in Mesopotamia.

## Contemporary relevance

What relevance is the Jacob story to us? If you grew up going to Bible classes, stories about 
Jacob, Esau, Leah, and Rachel might be relegated to the children’s section in your mind. If you’re 
a Christian, studying a narrative in the middle of the first book of the Old Testament might not 
seem as relevant as New Testament studies. However, learning about the stories in Genesis can 
deepen your understanding of the lengths God has and will go to rescue humanity.

### Heirs of the promise

In Galatians 3, Paul tries to prove the superiority of faith in Christ over adherence to the 
Torah/law and call the Galatians back to their spiritual anchor in Christ.

> <sup>7</sup> Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. <sup>23</sup> Now 
before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be 
revealed. <sup>24</sup> So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might 
be justified by faith. <sup>25</sup>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, 
<sup>26</sup> for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. <sup>27</sup> For as many 
of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <sup>28</sup> There is neither Jew nor 
Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ 
Jesus. <sup>29</sup> And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to 
promise.
>
> --Galatians 3:7, 23-29 (ESV)

Paul says that we’ve been made heirs of the promise to Abraham and God’s blessing through Christ. 
If we believe this, then there’s something to learn from the lives of those who carried this 
blessing before us and their relationship with God.
[Romans 11:17-18](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/romans/11/17-18) reminds us that we’ve been 
grafted into the tree and it’s not us who supports the root, but the root that supports us. The 
story of Jacob is the story about the foundation of the root that is Israel.

### The invincibility of God’s plan

The Jacob story illustrates the invincibility of God’s plan to rescue humanity. The people in the 
story are constantly grasping for what they want at the expense of others. The narrative makes it 
clear that such actions are unnecessary and harmful, but God works through and in spite of the 
grasping to advance the salvation plan. If ever you’ve wondered if God can save you or if what 
you’ve done will cause God to give up on you, this story can help correct the misconception that 
there are limits to God’s ability and desire to save.

### The source of blessing

Blessing is a major theme in the story of the life of Jacob. Who can bless and the limits of 
blessing are explored through the characters’ interactions with each other and God. While 
conceptually we might agree that God’s ability to bless is unbounded, it’s likely there are times 
we fall into the same scarcity mindset that the characters of the story do: “If someone else 
receives a blessing, that means I don’t get it.” Taken as a whole, the Jacob story challenges that 
God’s blessing is constrained.

## Structure

The main sections of the story of the Jacob Cycle form a chiasm. A chiasm is a literary device 
where a sequence leads toward a middle point and then is repeated in reverse order. This results in 
a sentence, poem, or story comprised of two halves which are mirror images of each other. The 
middle of a chiasm is the turning point and often the main or most important part of the sequence.
