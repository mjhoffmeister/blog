**The Jacob Cycle - Part 4**

## Structure

Like the previous episode, this one is divided up into seven sections. It's arranged chiastically 
with Isaac blessing Jacob in the center.[^1].

| --- |
| A. Esau marries Hittites - Genesis 26:34-35 |
| &ensp;&ensp; B. Isaac instructs Esau to prepare to be blessed - Genesis 27:1-5  
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; C. Rebekah instructs Jacob to acquire blessing - Genesis 27:6-17  
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; D. Isaac blesses Jacob: Genesis 27:18-29 
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; C'. Esau appeals to Isaac for blessing: Genesis 27:30-40 
| &ensp;&ensp; B’. Rebekah thwarts Esau’s revenge; Jacob send to Padam-Aram - Genesis 27:41-28:5
| A'. Esau marries an Ishmaelite - Genesis 28:6-9 |

Whereas "Yahweh" occurred 7 times in the story about Isaac and in Philistines, the noun "blessing" 
(*berakhah*) occurs 7 times and the verb "blessed" (*barak*) occurs 21 (7 X 3) times, establishing
blessing as the central theme.

## Esau marries Hittites

> <sup>34</sup> When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to
be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite, <sup>34</sup> and they made life bitter
for Isaac and Rebekah.
>
> --Genesis 26:34-35 (ESV)

These verses provide provide a transition from the previous section and frame the entire episode 
(Esau marries again in [Genesis 27:9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/9).) Esau marries two
Hittite women. Hittites are descended from Heth, who is listed as a son of Canaan in
[Genesis 10:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/10/15). As discussed in
[Part 1](beginnings.html#the-sale-of-the-birthright),
[Hebrews 12:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/hebrews/12/16) interprets Esau's sale of the birthright
and his marriages as a sign of faithlessness in Yahweh. His marriages, in particular, might suggest
serving other gods. The law later prohibits Israelites from marrying women from the nations because
doing so would turn them away from Yahweh
([Deuteronomy 7:3-4](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/deuteronomy/7/3-4).)

The names of Esau's wives and their fathers create a transition from the previous section and this
one. Beeri recalls the well (*be’er*) dug in
[Genesis 26:32](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/26/32). Elon sounds like *’alah*, echoing the
pact/oath made between Isaac and Abimelek in
[Genesis 26:28](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/26/28).[^2] Judith is connected to the verb "to 
praise" and Basemath has a connotation of a pleasant fragrance.[^3] All this is perhaps ironic word 
play. Isaac settled in Beersheba near plentiful water and at peace with the nations. Esau takes what
is praiseworthy and sweet-smelling to him, but it results in bitterness of spirit for Isaac and 
Rebekah.

We're not told what specifically causes the bitterness (*morath*, root *mrr*) of spirit, but the
detail serves an important literary role. Esau will cry out a great "bitter" (*marah*, root *mrr*)
scream after he learns that Jacob stole the blessing from him, and Rebekah will use it as a pretense
to send Jacob away to protect him from Esau seeking revenge.

## Isaac and Esau
Genesis 27:1-5

We’re told that Isaac is old (although he lives for many more years, compare Genesis 25:26, 35:28, 47:9, which suggest he lives through the time Joseph is in Potiphar’s house) (Walton: 728). We’re also told that he’s blind. This adds some plausibility to Jacob and Rebekah’s upcoming deception, but it also could an indicator of spiritual blindness. Isaac doesn’t “see” that Esau is unfit to carry on the blessing (Sarna: 190). We find, perhaps, an echo of Isaac’s condition in Eli in 1 Samuel 12-18. Eli was physically blind, but also spiritually blind to the unfitness of his sons Hophni and Phinehas to serve as priests. Eli dies after hearing his sons were killed in a battle with the Philistines by falling backwards out of his seat. His neck broke because he was “old and heavy.” He was a man of appetite, as Isaac proves to be.

Perhaps strangely, Isaac only calls Esau to give the blessing. In Genesis 49 and Genesis 50:24-25, Jacob and Joseph gather their families around them before they die. He also doesn’t appear to be concerned with correcting the issue of Esau marrying Canaanites as Abraham was at this stage in his life in Genesis 24:1-4 (Wenham: 204). Instead of addressing the problem of Esau’s marriages, his interest is in eating the food he loved before dispensing the blessing. These things taken together reflect poorly on Isaac, highlighting his favoritism for Esau and appetite above wisely making the way for the chosen seed of the woman to continue. However, the nature of the blessing that Isaac gives to whom he thinks is Esau will reinforce a possibility: that he intended to send Esau away (Walton: 553).

This is the first of three times in this section that Isaac’s eating is associated with his death: “I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die” (verse 4). The others are in Genesis 27:7 and Genesis 27:9-10. Eating is associated with death three times in Genesis 2, 3 regarding eating from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil and dying (Genesis 2:17, Genesis 3:3, Genesis 3:4-5.) By saying “that my soul may bless you” might indicate Isaac’s strong desire to bless Esau.

We’re told at the end of this segment that Rebekah witnessed this exchange. She is perhaps given another test here. She believes Jacob is the worthy heir of the promise but will she try to take it for Jacob or wait for God to give it to him? There is a hint given already: she was listening when Isaac spoke to “his” son, not “their” son. In verse 6 she’ll speak to “her” son, Jacob (Wenham: 206). The lines have been drawn.

## Rebekah and Jacob
Genesis 27:6-17

Rebekah decides to seize the blessing for Jacob through deception. She doesn’t repeat what she heard verbatim, perhaps to persuade Jacob to go along with her plan. She removes mention of Esau’s weapons and Isaac wanting to bless Esau with his “soul” (Wenham: 206). She adds Isaac saying “bless you before the Lord” to add importance to what is happening (Sarna: 190). Could this be recalling the serpent changing what God had said to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:1 (“Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden?’”)

Rebekah commands Jacob to go through with her plan. The concern he has isn’t a moral one; he doesn’t want to be caught and have to face the consequences (Wenham: 206). Rebekah reassures Jacob by saying she’ll bear the consequences and orchestrates a masquerade. The fact that the masquerade of Rebekah being only Isaac’s sister in Gerar was shown to be unnecessary sheds light on this one: such action was unnecessary for God to accomplish his purpose.

## Isaac and Jacob
Genesis 27:18-29

The ruse succeeds, perhaps surprisingly, as it seemed ridiculous with little chance of success. We’re perhaps being shown that with the plan’s success, we see God is working behind the scenes and the lengths God will go to protect his chosen one (Walton: 561). There will be consequences for Rebekah and Jacob’s actions, but the chosen seed of the woman will be given God’s blessing. Perhaps, also, Isaac is not quite as disabled as Rebekah believed (Wenham: 206).

What’s interesting about the blessing is what’s missing. It contains elements of abundance, fruitfulness, and authority, but there’s nothing about numerous descendants, the gift of the land, or being a blessing to the nations (Wenham: 208). Perhaps this reinforces the idea that Esau was to be sent away and Jacob would be given those parts of the blessing, instead.

Genesis 27:22 - perhaps echoed by Saul when he asks if it is David speaking to him in 1 Samuel 26:17 (Alter: 42). 

Rebekah acting - Alter: 63

## Isaac and Esau
Genesis 27:30-40

Esau returns and Jacob and Rebekah’s deception is revealed. Isaac and Esau’s distress is vividly described. Isaac “trembled a very great tremble” (Wenham: 211) and Esau “cried out with a very great and bitter scream.” There’s no doubt who the reader should pity. He twice “took” (laqah,) recalling Eve “taking” the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and bad in Genesis 3:6. Here also is the parallel of Isaac “Isaac-ing” Rebekah in Gerar. Esau says Jacob has “Jacob-ed” him here and when he was coerced into selling his birthright. It reminds us that this deception wasn’t necessary. Humans don’t need to take things into their own hands to get what God wants to give them freely.

Isaac and Esau believed that the blessing on Jacob was irrevocable. Esau only asks if there’s anything left for him. Isaac responds with a different blessing or “anti-blessing.” Jacob would receive abundance from heaven’s dew and the earth’s richness, Esau’s would live away from the richness of the earth and heaven’s dew. Note the reversal of dew/earth (Sarna: 194). Rather than live off the abundance of the land, the nation coming from Esau would be supported by violence, ostensibly through pillage (Ibid). Isaac utters a kind of oracle: although Edom would be subject to Israel, it would eventually break free and have revenge in the wake of Babylon’s conquest.

## Rebekah and Jacob
Genesis 27:41-45

Esau is perhaps linked to Cain here. Cain was angry (yihar, literally “hot”) that God didn’t favor his offering, so he rose up against his brother (ahi,) killed (yaharge) him, and was cursed from the ground. He was told he would be a wanderer on the earth (arets.) Esau would live away from the richness of the earth (arets) and wanted to kill (ahargah) his brother (ahi.) Rebekah tells Jacob to flee and stay in Haran until Esau’s anger (hamat, literally “heat”) turns away from him.

Literally, Rebekah directs Jacob to stay with Laban for “a few days” (Wenham: 212). The consequences of the deception will be more than she or Jacob anticipate. Jacob is away for 20 years and Rebekah will never see him again (Wenham: 216).

## Rebekah and Isaac
Genesis 27:46

Rebekah uses the situation of Esau’s marriages to Hittites to influence Isaac to send Jacob away to save him from Esau. Isaac is apparently of Esau’s intent. 

Isaac and Jacob
Genesis 28:1-5

Isaac takes the bait. He confirms the blessing given to Jacob and sends him to Laban. Nearly every phrase of the blessing is found in the promises to Abraham.

## Esau marries an Ishmaelite
Genesis 28:6-9 

The literary unit that started with Esau marrying Hittites neatly concludes with Esau marrying an Ishmaelite. Recognizing that marrying Canaanites displeased Isaac, he marries an Ishmaelite to try to gain favor. By doing so, he only connects himself a family line that was sent away (Walton: 569).

## Summary

Every character’s actions are morally suspect and the grasping is unnecessary. This story shows how God works through even human fallibility.
