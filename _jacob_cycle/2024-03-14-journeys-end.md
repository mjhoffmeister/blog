**The Jacob Cycle - Part 14**

The final scenes of the Jacob Cycle have numerous references to what has come before. The Abraham
and Joseph stories end similarly, illustrating the intentional design of Genesis and reinforcing the
idea that the stories of these generations elaborate on one another and are meant to be compared to
get their full meaning.

## Return to Bethel

### Going up

> <sup>1</sup> God said to Jacob, “**Arise**, **go up** to Bethel and **dwell (stay)** there. Make
an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”
>
> --Genesis 35:1 (ESV) [emphasis added]

> <sup>43</sup> "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. **Arise**, **flee** to Laban my brother in 
Haran <sup>44</sup> and **stay** with him a while, until your brother’s fury turns away—"
>
> --Genesis 27:43-44 (ESV) [emphasis added]

When Rachel commanded Jacob to flee to Haran, she told him to "arise," "flee," and "stay." At the 
end of the Jacob story, God commands Jacob to "arise," "go up," and "stay." Jacob’s flight from the 
land is being reversed.[^1]

"Go up" (*‘aleh*,) has the same root word (*‘lh*) as "ascending" (*‘olim*) in 
[Genesis 28:12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/12) where Jacob had the vision of angels 
ascending the stairway between earth and heaven.

> <sup>12</sup> And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of 
it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were **ascending [‘olim]** and descending on it!
>
> --Genesis 28:12 (ESV) [emphasis added]

*‘aleh* is connected to pilgrimage elsewhere in the Bible (for example, 
[1 Samuel 1:3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1-samuel/1/3) and 
[Jeremiah 31:6](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/jeremiah/31/6).)[^2] He's returning to the land, to 
the house of God, *beth-el*, and the gate of heaven. God commands him to build an altar, which
reminds us of Jacob’s promise to worship God at the end of the Bethel scene in 
[Genesis 28:21-22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/21-22). Building an altar is a
reaffirmation of his loyalty to Yahweh.[^3]

### Foreign gods

> <sup>2</sup> So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign 
gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments. <sup>3</sup> Then let us 
arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day 
of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.” <sup>4</sup> So they gave to Jacob all 
the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the 
terebinth tree that was near Shechem. 
>
> --Genesis 35:2-4 (ESV)

It's likely that the foreign gods were acquired along with the people and possessions taken from 
the Hivites (see [Genesis 34:29](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/34/20)). Worship of other 
gods is incompatible with loyalty to Yahweh 
([Exodus 20:3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/exodus/20/3),) so idols had to be purged from the 
community. Purification rituals found later in the Bible are often connected to preparing
oneself for encountering God. Changing clothes represents putting off an old way of life and taking 
up a new one.

After Jacob confesses that it was God who has protected him throughout, the people turn over their 
idols and earrings. The earrings might have had images or symbols of gods on them.[^5] The 
association with earrings and idolatry is reinforced in
[Exodus 32:2-3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/exodus/32/2-3), which is the next time the word "ring"
(*nezem*) appears in the Bible. There, the people give Aaron their earrings so that he can make the
golden calf.[^6]

> <sup>4</sup> So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods [*elohe*] that they had, and the rings
[*n<sup>e</sup>amim*] that were in their ears.
>
> --Genesis 35:4a (ESV)

> <sup>3</sup> So all the people took off the rings [*nizme*, "their rings"] of gold that were in
their ears and brought them to Aaron. <sup>4</sup> ... And they said, “These are your gods
[*elohe*], O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”
>
> --Exodus 32:3, 4b (ESV)

Surprisingly, Jacob doesn't destroy them. He instead hides them under the terebinth tree at Shechem. 
Abraham set up an altar to Yahweh at this tree when he first entered the land in 
[Genesis 12:6-7](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/12/6-7). It was probably originally a 
site of worship to a god or gods of Canaan. Abraham building an altar there would have been an act
of spiritual warfare claiming the superiority of Yahweh. Jacob hiding idols by burying them under
the tree could be just as good as destroying them as a sacred site would likely not be disturbed.

The hiding of the idols also recalls the Rebekah's theft of her father's household Gods, which was
parallel to Jacob deceiving his father in the theft of the blessing
([Genesis 27:35](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/35),
[Genesis 30:19-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/30/19-21)).[^7] This establishes a pattern
in the episode where burials are linked to previous deceptions, making death the ultimate
consequence of those deceptions as the Jacob story comes to an end.[^8] Here, foreign gods die,
including Laban's household gods. Rachel sitting them during her period
([Genesis 31:34-35](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/31/34-35)) made them ritually unclean and
could be seen as them being miscarried and hidden under the ground.[^9] This kind of link is made in
Job, where, after losing his possessions, children, and health, Job laments the day he was born,
saying "Why was I not as a hidden stillborn child?"
([Job 3:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/job/3/16)).

However, "hiding" lacks the sense of finality that "burying" does, and contrasts with the burials of
Deborah (Rebekah's nurse), Rachel, and Isaac later in the episode. Perhaps, Israel's future idolatry
is being foreshadowed. Although members of the chosen line die, its allegiance to foreign gods is
only hidden under the surface, not put to death.

### Bethel reaffirmed

> <sup>5</sup> And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, 
so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. <sup>6</sup> And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), 
which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him, <sup>7</sup> and there he 
built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when 
he fled from his brother.
>
> --Genesis 35:5-7 (ESV)

In [Genesis 34:30](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/34/30), it was hinted that Jacob's passive
response to the Dinah/Shechem situation stemmed from fear of the Hivites. His fear is proven 
unfounded. God prevents the Hivites from any vengeful pursuit.[^9] This is the second and last time
the word "terror" (*hittath*, root *htt*) appears in Genesis, the first time being when God said to
Noah that the "dread/terror" (*hit*, root *htt*) of humans would be on the animals after the flood.
([Genesis 9:2](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/9/2).) Immediately after, God included animals
as permitted food for humans. However, this communicated a wider gulf between the Eden ideal and the
state of the cosmos.[^10] Furthermore, God condemned killing other humans.

> <sup>6</sup> "Whoever sheds the blood of man,  
<sup>&ensp;</sup>&ensp;&ensp; by man shall his blood be shed,  
<sup>&ensp;</sup> for God made man in his own image."
>
> --Genesis 9:6 (ESV)

By connecting God's statement about the terror of humans coming on animals after the flood and the
terror of God coming on the cities that might have pursued Jacob after his sons' "flood" of
vengeance, the narrator imports the prohibition of humans killing other humans into the Jacob story.
Simeon and Levi's actions therefore receive more direct judgment.

We're reminded that the place formerly called Luz had been transformed into Bethel, "House of God," 
by God's appearance there. He built an altar, fulfilling his promise to God, and updates the name 
to El-Bethel “The God of Bethel,” establishing the continuity that it's been the same god that's 
been with Jacob his entire journey[^11]. Throughout all of Jacob's (and his sons') scheming, God has
worked through his chosen people in spite of them creating situations that threaten his rescue plan.

## The death of Deborah

> <sup>8</sup> And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So 
he called its name Allon-bacuth.
>
> --Genesis 35:8 (ESV)

The second burial scene is another surprise. The death of Deborah, Rebekah's nurse is recorded. It's
linked to the hiding of the idols under a terebinth tree.

> Jacob hid them *under the terebinth* [*takhat ha ’elah*]
>
> --Genesis 35:4

> And she was buried *under the oak* [*takhat ha ’allon*]
>
> --Genesis 35:8

As the hiding of the idols was linked to Rachel and Jacob's deceptions of their fathers, the burial
of Deborah is linked to Rebekah's orchestration of Jacob masquerading as Esau so that he could steal
the blessing from Isaac.[^12] Responding to Jacob's concern that if he were discovered, he'd be 
cursed instead of blessed, Rebekah responded, "Let your curse be on me..."
([Genesis 27:13](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/13)). The final fulfillment of that curse
seems to be realized here. Not only did Rebekah never see Jacob again after he was sent to Haran,
although she hoped he'd return after being there "a few days"
([Genesis 27:43](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/43),) she disappeared from the story. Her
nurse's death is recorded, but not hers. Genesis doesn't reveal that was buried with Isaac until
Jacob's death ([Genesis 49:31](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/49/31)).

Other than serve as the final reversal of Rebekah's involvement in the theft of the blessing,
Deborah's death could also underscore the purification of the nascent Israel as it returns to
Bethel. The things of people of Haran are passing away.[^13]

## God appears to Jacob

> <sup>9</sup> God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. 
<sup>10</sup> And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, 
but Israel shall be your name.” So he called his name Israel. <sup>11</sup> And God said to him, 
“I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from 
you, and kings shall come from your own body. <sup>12</sup> The land that I gave to Abraham and 
Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.” <sup>13</sup> Then 
God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him. <sup>14</sup> And Jacob set up a 
pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering 
on it and poured oil on it. <sup>15</sup> So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken 
with him Bethel.
>
> --Genesis 35:9-15 (ESV)

God appears to Jacob again at Bethel and reaffirms and reemphasizes his blessing and promises. God's
words to Jacob are a combination of promises to Abraham, Isaac's prayer before Jacob left for 
Haran, and the original promises to Jacob at Bethel, showing that since God called Abraham's family 
out of Haran, he has been faithful and trustworthy.[^14] Even though Jacob has impeded God's plan by
trying to force it to happen, God has worked through and overcome the impediments.

God renames Jacob "Israel" again, this time in the presence of his family and in the context of the
blessing of the chosen seed of the woman. Rather than a solo wrestling match, the scene is one of
communal worship. He anoints a pillar of stone, a reminder of the stairway he saw at Bethel and
stones that served as witnesses to God breaking through to help Jacob resolve threats, with wine and
oil, symbols of fruit, evoking Eden with its fruit trees.[^15] Another possible meaning of "Israel,"
"God/El rules," could be activated here, pairing the rule of God with the rule of the kings promised
to come from Jacob's line, perhaps pointing to the divine human that would come to lead humanity
back to Eden.[^16]

## The death of Rachel and birth of Benjamin

> <sup>16</sup> Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, 
Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor. <sup>17</sup> And when her labor was at its 
hardest, the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for you have another son.” <sup>18</sup> And as her 
soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him 
Benjamin. <sup>19</sup> So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, 
Bethlehem), <sup>20</sup> and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel’s 
tomb, which is there to this day.
>
> --Genesis 35:16-20 (ESV)

Jacob moves on from Bethel following the footsteps of Abraham as he first surveyed the land and 
paving the way for Joshua's conquest of Canaan. The same path taken by all three. Abraham and Jacob
accomplish an ideal, symbolic conquest before Joshua executes one by way of war.[^17]

The death of Rachel recalls her demanding children from Jacob, exclaiming she would die if she
didn't get what she wanted ([Genesis 30:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/30/1)), and Jacob
declaring that whoever Laban found with his household gods would be put to death
([Genesis 31:32](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/31/32)). Here, she tragically gets what she
wanted and loses her life for it. Furthermore, Jacob, who stole the blessing, survives, while
Rachel, who stole the household gods, dies.[^18]

Rachel's pregnancy contrasts with Rebekah's in
[Genesis 25:22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/22/23). Both pregnancies were difficult, but
where Rebekah called on Yahweh, Rachel expresses sorrow by calling her son Ben-Oni, "son of sorrow".
Jacob, having another son from his favorite wife, instead names him Benjamin, "son of my right
hand". The right-hand side was considered the favored or lucky side.[^19] Jacob continues following
the pattern of having favorites.

Rachel's tomb becomes a famous landmark referenced later in the Bible
([1 Samuel 10:2](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1-samuel/10/2))[^20]. The purpose of its reference
here could be to highlight that Jacob's favored wife isn't buried with him in the tomb of the chosen
line. That privilege is reserved for Leah, the unfavored wife
([Genesis 49:31](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/49/31)), whose son, Judah, would father the
kingly, messianic line.

## Reuben's challenge

> <sup>21</sup> Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder. <sup>21</sup> 
While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine. And Israel 
heard of it. 
>
> --Genesis 35:21-22a (ESV)

Migdal Eder means "herd tower" and was likely a place to protect flocks from raiders.[^21] It's 
south of Ephrath, showing that Jacob is continuing his symbolic conquest of Canaan. Jacob's new name
is used, signaling, perhaps, a deeper dedication and loyalty to Yahweh.

Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob's unloved wife Leah, sleeps with Bilhah to both prevent her from 
becoming the new favorite and as a challenge to Jacob’s authority. We saw the same with Ham in 
[Genesis 9:22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/9/22) ("saw the nakedness of his father" likely 
means that Ham slept with his mother[^22]), and Absolom will sleep with David's concubines as a 
challenge to his father's authority in 
[2 Samuel 16:22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2-samuel/16/22).[^23] However, by grasping for 
authority, Reuben loses all hope for it. Judah is now implicitly set up to carry on the line of the 
chosen seed of the woman. Reuben, Simeon, and Levi have all disqualified themselves, like Esau did.

Nevertheless, as Jacob hasn't presented himself as an attractive alternative to Esau, and Judah,
himself, will have his own failure following the pattern of Shechem. Shechem saw Dinah, the
"daughter of Leah" and "took" her. Judah saw Shua, the "daughter of a certain Canaanite" and "took"
her ([Genesis 38:2](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/38/2).) This leads to a chain of events
where Judah unknowingly sleeps with his deceased son's wife and has twins by her. During the twins'
delivery, one sticks out his hand, and a crimson thread is tied on it to designate him as the
firstborn (the root word translated "crimson" is *shnh*, which means to elevate or exalt.) However,
he withdraws his hand, and brother, the latecomer, is born first. He's named "Perez" after the word
for "breach", *prts*. *prts* is also the root word for "spread out," used in the promise to Jacob at
Bethel that his descendants would "spread abroad" to cover the earth
([Genesis 28:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/14)). From Perez's line would come David
and Jesus. The point is that all of God's chosen, except for Jesus, disqualify themselves from their
position at some point. It isn't by their merit that God works through them, it's by God's choice,
and it's only by God becoming a human that a chosen one can live up to the calling of the position.

## The list of Jacob's sons

> Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.  
> &ensp;<sup>23</sup> The sons of Leah:  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn),  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.  
> &ensp;<sup>24</sup> The sons of Rachel:  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Joseph and Benjamin.  
> &ensp;<sup>25</sup> The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s servant:  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Dan and Naphtali.  
> &ensp;<sup>26</sup> The sons of Zilpah, Leah’s servant:  
> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Gad and Asher.  
> These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
>
> --Genesis 35:22b-26 (ESV)

Now that Benjamin is born, a full list of his sons can be given. They're grouped by mother and set 
up in a chiasm to emphasize Jacob's favoritism and the rifts in the family, setting up the Joseph 
story.[^24]

## The death of Isaac

> <sup>27</sup> And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), 
where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned. <sup>28</sup> Now the days of Isaac were 180 years. 
<sup>29</sup> And Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full 
of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
>
> --Genesis 35:27-29 (ESV)

Mamre is a significant place in the Bible. It's associated with names meaning "fatness" and 
"cluster of grapes" ([Genesis 14:13](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/14/13)).[^25]. Abraham 
settled there after he and Lot separated and built an alter to Yahweh 
([Genesis 13:18](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/13/18)). God appeared to him and promised that
Isaac would be born in a year 
([Genesis 18:1-10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/18/1-10).) It's Eden-space.

Isaac's death links back to his desire to bless Esau because he believed his death was imminent
([Genesis 27:2](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/2),
[Genesis 27:4](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/4)). This led to the theft of the blessing,
orchestrated by Rebekah and carried out by Jacob. Isaac survives the entirety of Jacob's exile, not
dying only after he returned. The tragedy of Isaac's favoritism and Jacob's deception is recalled
as the Jacob story ends.[^26]

Isaac's burial echoes Abraham's in [Genesis 25:7-9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/7-9). 
Isaac and Ishmael came together after being estranged to bury Abraham. Esau and Jacob's 
reconciliation is reinforced as they bury Isaac together.

The story of Jacob ends with him making peace with his past, but having set up a situation that 
will lead to more conflict in the future.

## Conclusion

What we've seen in Jacob’s story is that God desired to bless and protect the chosen seed of the 
woman so that all people of the world could be brought back to God and Eden and take part in that 
blessing. Grasping for that blessing was unnecessary and only delayed what God wanted to give 
freely. Nevertheless, God still worked through the difficult situations caused by human taking. 
His plan to rescue humanity cannot be stopped, not even by those he’s working to rescue.

It also reveals that allegiance to Yahweh doesn't magically result in becoming perfect. Jacob was 
“baptized” in the Jabbok river after wrestling with God, but his old nature remained; we see it 
in the Joseph story. Nevertheless, the writer of Hebrews commends Jacob’s faith at the end of his 
life in [Hebrews 11:21](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/hebrews/11/21).

If we feel overwhelmed at our sin or lack of perfection, we can know that God can work through it 
and in spite of it and can change us. If we feel frustrated that things aren't working out in our 
efforts for God’s kingdom, we can return to this story and ask “Am I grasping, or am I allowing 
myself to freely receive God’s blessing and let it flow from me?”
