**The Jacob Cycle - Part 7**

After Jacob apparently works a month for Laban, Laban asks him what his wages should be. This begins
a reversal of Jacob's actions in Canaan. Once again, there's no mention of God, but the connections 
back to the previous sections show that God is reforming him into the kind of human he wants him to 
be as the chosen seed of the woman.

## Structure

This episode is divided into 4 parts.[^1]

1. The betrothal of Jacob and Rachel - Genesis 29:15-19
2. Seven years of service for Rachel - Genesis 29:20
3. The wedding - Genesis 29:21-30a
4. Another seven years of service - Genesis 29:30b

## The betrothal of Jacob and Rachel

### From nephew to servant

> <sup>15</sup> Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me
for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?”
>
> --Genesis 29:15 (ESV)

On the surface, especially within our cultural context, it appears that Laban is being friendly
towards Jacob and concerned about his wellbeing. However, this wage bartering between family members
is likely meant to be discomforting, especially given how the words "work" and "wages" are used
later in the context of Jacob being exploited by Laban.[^2] By offering wages, Laban makes the 
relationship transactional instead of relational.

In verse 13, Jacob told Laban "all these things," so Laban understands Jacob's situation: that he
needs protection from Esau and that he's been charged by Isaac to find a wife from among Laban's
daughters. He also knows that, coming empty-handed, he isn't able to pay the culturally-required
bride-price (see [Wage negotiations](#wage-negotiations).) Furthermore, it's likely safe to assume
that Laban knows that Jacob loves Rachel given the narrator's disclosure of that information in
verse 18. Laban has all the information he needs to weaken the uncle/nephew relationship and make a
servant out of Jacob.[^3]

The root word for "serve" (*‘vd*) occurs 7 times in this section (one is hidden in verse 27 in
English; Laban says in return for "**serving** that [the additional seven years] **service**" Jacob
may marry Rachel.)[^4] Jacob is shown to be made completely subservient to Laban, in tension with
God's words to Rebekah that the nation coming from Jacob would be served by the nation coming from
Esau. Rebekah and Jacob's attempts to force the oracle to happen have led to a situation opposite to
the one God intended. Nevertheless, God will work through it to protect the seed of the woman and
bring Jacob out of bondage. Once again, the Jacob Cycle looks ahead to Israel's enslavement in Egypt
and the exodus. The Egyptians will make the Israelites work as "slaves" (*ya‘avidu*, root *‘vd*;
[Exodus 1:13-14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/exodus/1/13014).)

The root word for "wages" (*maskurt*,) is another keyword, appearing 12 times while Jacob is in 
Haran. The last time it appears, in [Genesis 31:41](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/31/41), we 
learn that Laban will have changed Jacob's wages 10 times. Throughout the story, wages will be used
as a way to weaken Jacob's position and agency.

### Leah and Rachel contrasted

> <sup>16</sup> Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the
younger was Rachel. <sup>17</sup> Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and
appearance. Jacob loved Rachel.
>
> --Genesis 29:16-18a (ESV)

The narrator proceeds with background information about Leah and Rachel. The names of the sisters
are likely juxtaposed to highlight Jacob's preference for Rachel. Leah can mean "wild cow" and
Rachel means "ewe lamb".[^5] Leah is described as having "weak" or "tender" (*rakoth*) eyes, which
describes the aesthetic quality of her eyes in contrast to Rachel's beauty.[^6] It's likely a 
deliberately peculiar way to inform us that Jacob preferred Rachel because of her physical 
appearance. He's about to be deceived by the Laban and the "weak-eyed" Leah. In Canaan, he and 
Rebekah deceived the "dim-eyed" Isaac.

This passage parallels the descriptions of Esau and Jacob and the favoritism of their parents in 
[Genesis 25:27-28](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/27-28.) Isaac loved Esau because of what
Esau could offer him: food that he loved. Jacob loves Rebekah because of her beauty. He's falling 
into the places of Esau and Isaac whom he manipulated and deceived. Jacob was initially described as
*tam*, "blameless" or "having integrity"
([Genesis 25:27](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/27),) perhaps ironically, in contrast to
Abimelek who took Sarah in the "integrity of his heart" in
[Genesis 20:6](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/20/6), not knowing that she was Abraham's wife 
(see [Part 3](issac-and-the-philistines.html#outrage).) While God's promises to Jacob have all been
without condition, he wants to reform Jacob into a model of the seed of the woman that will 
ultimately crush the head of the serpent. He'll do this by revisiting Jacob's scheming and 
deceptions on him as discipline to encourage repentance.

### Wage negotiations

> <sup>18</sup> And he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”
<sup>19</sup> Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any
other man; stay with me.”
>
> --Genesis 29:18b-19

The offer of seven years of service is for the typical bride-price, which was a fixed amount paid by 
the groom in compensation for the loss of the bride's contributions to the family and her potential 
children.[^7] Abraham's servant gave Laban and his mother "costly ornaments" as the bride-price for 
Rebekah in [Genesis 24:53](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/24/53). As we know, however, Jacob
arrived in Haran with nothing, so the only thing he has to offer is himself. Hiring oneself out on
contract as an indentured servant was a common practice in Jacob's time and place. An Assyrian
tablet records a man offering ten years of service for a wife, food, and clothing.[^8]

It's possible that Jacob's offer of seven years of service is well beyond what would have been
typical.[^9] If so, this exchange strongly echoes Esau's sale of the birthright to Jacob. Jacob,
understanding Esau's nature, manipulated him into trading something of great value for a bowl of
lentil soup, which Esau likely thought was something more substantial such as meat stew or blood
broth (see [Part 2 - The sale of the birthright](beginnings.html#the-sale-of-the-birthright).) 
Jacob exchanges seven years of service, possibly of greater value than a typical bride-price for 
Rachel; instead, he'll receive Leah.

Laban accepts in a conspicuously ambiguous way, not outright agreeing or even naming which daughter
he's thinking of allowing Jacob to marry.[^10] His statement, "stay with me" echoes Rebekah's 
instruction to "stay with him" ([Genesis 27:44](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/44).)[^11]

## Seven years of service for Rachel

> <sup>20</sup> So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days
because of the love he had for her.
>
> --Genesis 29:20 (ESV)

The seven years Jacob works for Rachel only seeming like "a few days" is a link back to Rebekah
instructing him to stay with Laban for "a few days" in
[Genesis 27:44](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/44) before returning home. So, Jacob is
likely expecting to return home after these "few days."[^11] Neither Laban nor God will be finished
with him after that time, however. It's time for the deceiver to be deceived.

## The wedding

### Masquerade

> <sup>21</sup> Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is
completed.” <sup>23</sup> So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast.
<sup>23</sup> But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in
to her. <sup>24</sup> (Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)
>
> --Genesis 29:21-24 (ESV)

The narrative immediately progresses to the point after Jacob served seven years, allowing us to 
share in the short relative time that Jacob experienced. He demands that Laban give him Rachel so
that he can consummate the marriage in the same way that he demanded Esau sell him the birthright,
without saying "please," using a verb in the imperative form, and stressing urgency with a form of
the word "day."

> Jacob said, "Sell [*mikrah*, imperative] me your birthright now [*yom*, 'day'.]"
>
> --Genesis 25:31 (ESV)

> Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give [*havah*, imperative] me my wife that I may go in to her, for my
time [*yama*, root *yom*, 'day'] is completed."
>
> --Genesis 29:21 (ESV)

However, this time, Jacob won't immediately get what he wants, and it's he who will trade something 
of greater value, his seven years of service, for something of lesser value in his eyes, Leah. Laban
is in control of the situation. The turning point has arrived.

The Hebrew word translated "feast", *mishteh*, might imply a feast with copious drinking (the root
word is *sth*, "drink".) So, it might not be a stretch to imagine Jacob drinking too much, giving 
Laban's plan a greater chance of success. It's noted that Laban implemented his plan
"in the evening," recalling Isaac's "dim" eyes
([Genesis 27:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/1)) and Jacob stopping at the place that he
would name Bethel because the "the sun had set"
([Genesis 28:11](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/11).) The physical blindness in these 
scenes points to the spiritual blindness of the chosen one. Here, an unrepentant and uncommitted 
(and perhaps drunk) Jacob is unable to see through the masquerade. In addition to the darkness of 
evening, Leah was likely veiled per the customs of the time.[^12] This all contributes to the main
point of the narrative: Jacob is being deceived in the same manner as he deceived Isaac.

It's noted that Laban gives Zilpah to Leah as a servant. It might seem like a strange interruption,
but its narrative purpose is to connect Leah and Zilpah as future matriarchs of the chosen
line.[^13]

### Unmasking

> <sup>25</sup> And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you
have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”
<sup>26</sup> Laban said, “It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the
firstborn. <sup>27</sup> Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in
return for serving me another seven years.” <sup>28</sup> Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then
Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. <sup>29</sup> (Laban gave his female servant
Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.) <sup>30</sup> So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and
he loved Rachel more than Leah...
>
> --Genesis 29:25-30a (ESV)

In the light of morning, Jacob discovers the deception. He echoes the words of Isaac to Esau when
they discovered Jacob's deception in [Genesis 27:35](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/35):
"Your brother came deceitfully..."[^14] Laban responds, literally, "It is not done in our place to
give the younger before the firstborn." "Place" *m<sup>e</sup>qome* recalls Bethel, which was just a
"place" (*maqom*) to Jacob before God revealed himself and Jacob renamed it. There, God promised
Jacob that he would be with him wherever he went
([Genesis 28:15](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/15).) Laban's statement about it not being
their custom to give the younger before the firstborn leaves Jacob speechless. What he had done to
Isaac and Esau is now being done to him. He elevated himself, the younger, above Esau, the
firstborn. The reminder of Bethel is set in tension with Jacob experiencing the wrong he's inflicted
on others. It can be viewed as God's discipline to reshape Jacob and demonstrate that he can and 
will work through his chosen one, regardless of his failings.

Instead of a verbal response, Jacob silently accepts Laban's offer to work another seven years for
Rachel. We're perhaps intended to wonder if this is the appropriate response. In Biblical narrative, 
marrying multiple wives is generally demonstrated to cause problems and not align with God's plan. 
The first man who had two wives in the Bible was Lamech, the seventh generation from the line of
Cain, was also the second murderer in the Bible and boasted about it. Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham 
to try to resolve her barrenness on her own, contrary to God's plan. In the Jacob Cycle itself,
Esau's first two wives caused "bitterness of spirit" in Isaac and Rebekah. Leah will be the mother 
of Judah, the line of Israel's kings and Jesus himself. She'll survive the return to Canaan, while
Rachel won't. Jacob's persistent favoritism for Rachel and his children by her will ultimately lead
to the nascent Israel relocating to Egypt and becoming enslaved there. Leah, though the firstborn,
as the unloved wife is the lesser between her and her sister. Up to this point in Genesis, God has
been choosing the lesser to be his chosen one. Maybe, Leah was the only one God intended Jacob to
marry. If Jacob, confronted with what he had done in Canaan had repented here, would he have
recognized it? Regardless, God will work through both wives, and their servants, to bring about the
births of the patriarchs of the twelve tribes of Israel, demonstrating the invincibility of his plan
despite imperfect people and situations.

After completing the required week with Leah, Jacob marries Rachel, committing to another seven
years of service to Laban. The introduction of Rachel's servant Bilhah sets the stage for further
complications in Jacob’s family. Here, the matriarchs of the tribes of Israel are presented: Leah,
Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah. Leah and Rachel will both experience barrenness, and, like Sarah before
them, will attempt to resolve it by giving their servants to Jacob to bear children on their behalf.
This, combined with Jacob's clear preference for Rachel over Leah, suggests that more familial
discord is imminent. Despite these issues, God's plan remains firm. He continues to work through the
failings and favoritism of His chosen people, committed to reforming Jacob along the way.

## Another seven years of service

> <sup>30</sup> ...and served Laban for another seven years.
>
> --Genesis 29:20b (ESV)

The episode ends with Jacob committed to another seven years of service to Laban. These do not pass
"like a few days," however.[^15] Jacob and Rebekah's hopes of a swift return to Canaan are dashed.
God has more work to do with Jacob in Haran.
