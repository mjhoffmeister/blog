**The Jacob Cycle - Part 7**

Genesis 29:15-19 - On the surface, especially within our cultural context, it appears that Laban is being friendly towards Jacob and concerned about his wellbeing. However, this wage bartering between family members is likely meant to be discomforting, especially given how the words “work” and “wages” are used later in the context of Jacob being exploited by Laban (Wenham: 234). As the story progresses, Jacob appears to in a position of indentured servanthood more than a member of Laban’s family.

The root for “serve” (‘bd) occurs 7 times in this section (one is hidden in verse 27 in English; Laban says in return for “serving that [the additional seven years] service” Jacob may marry Rachel ) (Sarna: 203). Jacob is shown to be made completely subservient to Laban, in tension with God’s words to Rachel that the nation coming from Jacob would be served by the nation coming from Esau. Rebekah and Jacob’s attempts to force the oracle to happen have led to a situation opposite to the one God intended. Nevertheless, God will work through it to protect the seed of the woman and bring Jacob out of bondage.

This, again, looks ahead to Israel’s enslavement in Egypt and the Exodus. It also give us hope today. No matter how enslaved you are to things outside of Eden, God’s plan is to bring you back and he can accomplish that plan (Jesus is the stairway.)

We get a small interruption to receive background information about Leah and Rachel. The names of the sisters are likely juxtaposed to highlight Jacob’s preference for Rachel. Leah can mean “wild cow” and Rachel means “ewe lamb” (Wenham: 234). Leah is described as having “weak” or “tender” (rakoth) eyes, which describes the aesthetic quality of her eyes rather than her vision (Sarna: 204). Nevertheless, perhaps there’s some poetic justice in Jacob being fooled by Laban and Leah who has “weak” eyes after he had fooled Isaac by taking advantage of his “dim” eyes.

In general, Jacob’s preference for Rachel is presented as being based on her outward appearance. Offering years of service for a wife, food, and clothing is documented elsewhere in tablets found in the area (Sarna: 204). Laban accepts in a conspicuously ambiguous way, not outright agreeing or even naming which daughter he’s thinking of.

Genesis 29:20-30 - The seven years Jacob works for Rachel only seeming like “a few days” is a link back to Rebekah instructing him to stay with Laban for “a few days” in Genesis 27:44 before returning home. So, Jacob is likely expecting to return home after these “few days” (Wenham: 20).

Jacob seems to demand that Laban fulfill his part of the agreement, perhaps that Laban was reluctant to follow through (Wenham: 235). Regardless, Laban arranges the customary marriage feast.

As Rebekah and Jacob used a masquerade to deceive Isaac who had “dim” vision, Laban and Leah use a masquerade to deceive Jacob in the dim light of evening. Leah was likely veiled per the customs of that time and place. We get a note about Zilpah being given to Leah as a servant or maid. It might seem like a strange interruption, but its narrative purpose is to connect Leah and Zilpah as future matriarchs of the chosen line (Wenham: 235).

Jacob discovers the deception. He echoes the words of Isaac to Esau when they discovered Jacob’s deception in Genesis 27:35: “Your brother came deceitfully...” (Sarna: 205). The reversal of Jacob’s deception continues. Laban says, literally, “It is not done in our place to to set the younger before the firstborn.” Jacob continues to suffer the consequences of his previous actions. He’s being treated as he treated others (Walton: 593). Jacob has no response. Perhaps he perceives that his actions towards Esau and Isaac are coming back around to him (Sarna: 205).

Nevertheless, Laban agrees to let Jacob marry Rachel for another 7 years of servitude. There’s no mention of time passing quickly; Rebekah’s hope that Jacob would return within “a few days,” whether literally or figuratively, is destroyed.

Like with Leah, Rachel is given a maid/servant. We’re presented with all the matriarchs of the tribes of Israel: Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah.

The section ends with tension as we’re told Jacob favors Rachel of Leah. Based on what we read before with Isaac and Rebekah’s favoritism, we’re left to expect more conflict.
