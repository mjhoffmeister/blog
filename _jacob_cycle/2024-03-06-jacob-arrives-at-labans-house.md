**The Jacob Cycle - Part 6**

This begins the central part of the Jacob story, a “story-within-a-story,” with the “middle-of-the-middle” being the birth of Jacob’s sons (Wenham: 227).

A. Jacob arrives at Laban’s house
	B: Laban outwits Jacob
		C: The birth of Jacob’s sons
	B’: Jacob outwits Laban
A’. Jacob leaves Laban

While there’s not a formal betrothal in these verses, there’s a connotation of one because of their similarity to the scene between Abraham’s servant and Rebekah at a well in Genesis 24:10-61, Moses and Zipporah in Exodus 2:15-21, and others (Ruth, essentially a book about a betrothal, links to the other betrothal stories in interesting ways) (Alter: 65).

Genesis 29:1 - Jacob literally “lifts up his feet,” a phrase that doesn’t appear anywhere else in the Bible. It could mean that Jacob has left Bethel with energy or confidence after his experience with God (Sarna: 201).

In Genesis, “eastward” is associated with separation from God in Genesis. When Adam and Eve were exiled from the garden, the cherubim were placed on the east side of the garden (Genesis 3:24) (Sailhamer: 139). Cain went away from God’s presence after he killed Abel east of Eden (Genesis 4:16.) The people involved in the building of the tower of Babel had migrated east (Genesis 11:2). So, there’s a tension here. On one hand, Jacob is moving away from God in the cosmic geography, away from Bethel, the House of God and a gate of heaven. On the other hand, God said that he would be with him and guard him wherever he went (Genesis 28:15.)

Genesis 29:2-8 - The narrator explains that in the field Jacob comes to, all the flocks in the area would gather and then the shepherd’s would roll a stone away from the mouth of the well there to water the sheep. The size of the stone is “great” (gadol,) implying that all the shepherds were needed to roll it away.

Jacob has a conversation with the shepherds gathering around the well. We might be expected to think back to Isaac’s encounters with the shepherd’s in Gerar around wells. Will there be conflict here between the chosen one and the shepherds?

Instead of conflict between Jacob and the shepherds (although there might be some tension in the conversation [Wenham: 229],) there is conflict between the stone and the shepherds. They all must gather before there is enough collective strength for the stone to be rolled away. They can’t “prevail” (ykl) against it individually. This is the first time out of seven that the word “prevail” occurs in the Jacob story. The fourth time it appears - the middle occurance - is when Jacob wrestles with God and is renamed Israel.

Genesis 29:9-12 - During the conversation, suspense builds as Rachel approaches. Rachel arrives at the well and we receive the confirmation that God has indeed gone with Jacob out of the land and Bethel. Not only has God led him to his extended family, but he gives him supernatural strength to single-handedly remove the stone from the well.

We’re finding that stones are significant symbols in the Jacob story (Fokkelman: 125). At Bethel, Jacob slept on a stone and then set it up as a commemorative pillar after encountering God. Throughout the story, we’ll see that they serve as a witness to events between Jacob and God and humans. The word “stone,” eben, occurs 12 times. The same number of sons Jacob has in the center of the story.

Rachel runs to tell her father that a relative has arrived.

Genesis 29:13-14 - In Genesis 24:29-31, Laban sees the gold ring and bracelets that Abraham’s servant gave to Rebekah and responds enthusiastically. Since later in the Jacob story  it’s implied that Laban is overly concerned with material gain, an intentional question might be posed: is Laban disappointed that Jacob didn’t come with riches (Wenham: 230)?

Jacob recounts at least some part of his story to Laban. This convinces Laban that Jacob is his nephew. The word “certainly,” “truly” (ak) might suggest that Laban begrudgingly admits that Jacob is family and allows him to stay. A month passes before the story continues. Already Rebekah’s hopes that Jacob would stay only a few days (Genesis 29:30) are dashed (Wenham: 230).
