**The Jacob Cycle - Part 11**

As Jacob departs Gilead, he encounters angels of God. "Angels," *mal’ake*, is, literally,
"messengers." Jacob then sends his own messengers with a gift for Esau, suing for peace.

## Structure

The episode is divided into three scenes.[^1]

1. Divine and human messengers
2. Jacob prays for protection
3. Jacob's plan for protection

Jacob's return to the land is parallel to Jacob leaving the land in
[Genesis 28:10-22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/10-22), where Jacob had a dream of angels
and received promises from Yahweh. There are also links to the flood narrative in
Genesis 6-7. In [Genesis 27:41-42](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/41-42), Esau was set on
analogy to God in Genesis 6 (see
[Part 4](jacob-steals-esaus-blessing.html#jacob-sent-to-padam-aram).) The thread from Esau is posed
as a flood. Will Jacob trust in God's protection, or will he take his own defensive measures?

## Divine and human messengers

### Divine messengers

> <sup>1</sup> Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. <sup>2</sup> And when Jacob saw
them he said, “This is God’s camp!” So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
>
> --Genesis 32:1–2 (ESV)

The phrase "angels of God" occurs only in Jacob's dream at Bethel
([Genesis 28:12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/12)) and here, creating a strong link 
between the scenes.[^2] Jacob saw angels as he left the land, and he sees them again as he returns.
The phrase "And he called the name of that place Bethel/Mahanaim" (*wa yiqra’ eth shem ha maqom ha
hu’ bethel/mahanayim*, note *eth* isn't present in Genesis 32:2) is another link. In both instances,
Jacob came upon an unnamed "place" and gave it a name corresponding to the revelation he received
there. However, Jacob came upon a "place" as he was leaving the land when "the sun had set"
([Genesis 28:11](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/11).) He re-enters the land in the morning
([Genesis 31:55](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/31/55).)

Mahanaim means "two camps." The two camps are likely Jacob's camp and a corresponding heavenly one.
Given the connection with Bethel, where heaven and earth were connected by a stairway and God
promised that he'd return Jacob to the land, be with him, and protect him, the message is that Jacob
has supernatural help as he re-enters the land and faces Esau.[^3] Exodus 23:20 and Psalm 91:11
match the phrasing of Jacob's vow in the Bethel episode.[^4]

| Genesis 28:20b | Genesis 32:1 | Exodus 23:20a | Psalm 91:11 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "If God will be with me and will keep [*sh<sup>e</sup>mara*, root *shmr*] me in this way [*derek*, root *drk*] that I go..." | Jacob went on his way [*dark*, root *drk*], and the angels of God met him. | Behold, I send an angel before you to guard [*sh<sup>e</sup>mar*, root *shmr*] you on the way [*darek*, root *drk*]... | For he will command his angels concerning you to guard [*sh<sup>e</sup>mar*, root *shmr*] you in all your ways [*d<sup>e</sup>reke', root *drk*] |

Interestingly, Psalm 91 is in a group of psalms starting Book IV of Psalms which follows the failure
of the Davidic kingship (Book III) and the fall of the temple (Book IV.) This group, comprised of
Psalms 90-92, begins with the title "A prayer of Moses, the man of God." They echo Deuteronomy
32-33, which contemplates a new generation of Israelites entering Canaan.[^5] The psalm group
expresses the need for a new Moses to lead Yahweh's people to his dwelling place and sabbath rest.
Jacob prefigures Moses, who, with the help of the angel of Yahweh will prefigure the Messiah who
would lead God's people back to Eden. Jude identifies Jesus the Messiah as the one who rescued
Israel out of Egypt ([Jude 5](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/jude/5).)

### Human messengers

#### Message

> <sup>3</sup> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the
country of Edom, <sup>4</sup> instructing them, “Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your
servant Jacob, ‘I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now. <sup>5</sup> I have oxen, donkeys,
flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find
favor in your sight.’”
>
> --Genesis 32:3–5 (ESV)

Jacob sends his own messengers to Esau in an attempt to discover Esau's attitude towards him.
Terminology is used to remind us of how Jacob tricked and stole from Esau. Esau is covered with
hair, *se’ar*, which sounds like *se’ir*, "Seir". He's a man of the field, *sedar*, the same word
used here for "country." He was born *’adom*, "red," evoking *edom*, Edom. Esau came from the
**field** and sold his birthright to Jacob for **red** stew. His blessing was stolen by Jacob who
wore **hairy** goat skins to deceive Isaac.[^6]

His message to Esau is placating and deferential. He calls Esau "my lord" and himself "his
servant."[^7] He also describes his wealth, suggesting that he's willing to pay Esau off. This is in
contrast to the blessing that Isaac gave to him in
[Genesis 27:29](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/29), where it was said he would be "lord"
over his brothers. It also contrasts with the anti-blessing Isaac gave to Esau, where he said Esau
would serve his brother ([Genesis 27:40](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/27/40).) Even before
receiving a response from his messengers, he's formulating a plan for how to protect himself, 
despite already having the protection of God's heavenly camp. Jacob's tendency to grasp for what God
has offered freely led to this moment where Jacob's intended elevated role has been reversed. Yet,
he still continues operating in the same way.

Jacob's states that his motivation is to "find favor" in Esau's "sight."[^8] This re-establishes the
connection to the flood narrative first made in Genesis 27 where Esau's response to Jacob's theft
of the birthright was set on analogy to God's response to the evil of humanity in Genesis 6. In
[Genesis 6:8](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/6/8), Noah found "favor" in the "eyes/sight" of
Yahweh. The reason is perhaps given in verse 9, where he's described as "righteous," "blameless in
his generation," and that he "walked with God." "Blameless" is *tammim*, corresponding to Jacob 
being described, perhaps ironically, as *tam* in
[Genesis 25:27](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/25/27). Perhaps, Jacob's undeniable guilt is
being highlighted.

#### Response

> <sup>6</sup> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and he
is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.” <sup>7</sup> Then Jacob was greatly
afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels,
into two camps, <sup>8</sup> thinking, “If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp
that is left will escape.”
>
> --Genesis 32:6–8 (ESV)

The report that Esau is "coming to meet him" with 400 mean is ambiguous and meant to be
suspenseful.[^9] The phrase "coming to meet" in the Bible is used in both violent and non-violent
contexts. "400 men" is used in 1 Samuel to describe the size of a militia several times.[^10]

Jacob, afraid of being attacked by Esau, divides his camp into two so that if one is attacked, the
other can escape. His lack of trust in the heavenly camp is confirmed. He called the place where he
met the angels of God *makhanaim*, "Two Camps." He now divides his camp into two camps, *makhanot*,
in case the heavenly camp isn't enough protection.

The word "left" is *nishar* (root *sh’r*), "remnant," a rare word in Genesis. It was first used in
[Genesis 7:23](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/7/23), describing the remnant of Noah and his
family after the flood.

> <sup>23</sup> He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and
animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only
Noah was left [*yisha’er*, root *sh’r*], and those who were with him in the ark.
>
> --Genesis 7:23 (ESV)

This establishes a link between this episode and the flood narrative, which will be further
developed. Jacob, in a way, will build his own ark, but at his own initiative, whereas Noah built
one on God's initiative.

## Jacob prays for protection

> <sup>9</sup> And Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who
said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,’ <sup>10</sup> I am
not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have
shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two
camps. <sup>11</sup> Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I
fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children. <sup>12</sup> But you said,
‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered
for multitude.’”
>
> --Genesis 32:9–12 (ESV)

While Jacob turns to prayer in awareness of his vulnerability, he does so only after first trying to
protect his camp dividing it in two, leaving half exposed to potential attack. His prayer here
recalls Bethel, where God appeared to him before he fled to Haran, and we see him reiterating God’s
promises as he calls on the Lord.

| Bethel | Mahanaim |
| --- | --- |
| "I am Yahweh, the god of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac" | "O god of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Yahweh..." |
| "Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth" | "'I will...make your offspring as the sand of the sea'" |
| "I will bring you back to this land" | "'Return to your land'" |
| "He was afraid" | "Jacob was greatly afraid," "I fear him" |

While there are elements of humility and gratitude in his appeal, Jacob’s allegiance seems
conflicted. For the first time, he invokes Yahweh’s name sincerely as the God of his fathers. He
acknowledges his unworthiness of God's loyal love (*khesed*) and faithfulness (*’emet*), appealing
not on the basis of his own merit but on Yahweh's grace.[^11] This confession parallels the humility
of Abraham’s servant when he prayed after finding Rebekah for Isaac:[^12]

> <sup>27</sup> “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham [*yahweh ’elohey ’adoni,
y’avraham*], who has not forsaken his steadfast love [*khasd*, root *khesed*] and his faithfulness
[*’amit*, root *’emet*] toward my master.”
>
> --Genesis 24:27a (ESV)

> <sup>9</sup> And Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD
[*’elohey ’avi y’avraham we ’elohey ’avi y yitskhaq yahweh*] who said to me, ‘Return to your country
and to your kindred, that I may do you good,’ <sup>10</sup> I am not worthy of the least of all the
deeds of steadfast love [*kh<sup>a</sup>sadim*, root *khesed*] and all the faithfulness
[*’emet*]...”
>
> --Genesis 32:9-10a

In both instances, the future of the chosen line is at stake. God effectively arranged the marriage
between Rebekah and Isaac to overcome the threat in Abraham's time. He'll arrange events to protect
Jacob, even if Jacob's faith is weaker than Abraham's servant was.

Jacob calls himself Yahweh's servant. However, he just called himself Esau's servant, illustrating
a divided allegiance that he's willing to give to whomever will keep him safe.[^13] His reference to
his "two camps" acknowledges that God has blessed him, but it also betrays that he doesn't trust in
the protection of God's camp.

Jacob asks God to deliver (*ntsl*) him from Esau, using the same term that he did to describe God
"rescuing" Laban's livestock by given them to him in his questionable description of his dream in
[Genesis 31:9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/31/9). He now seeks God's true rescue whereas
before he might have used the term deceptively to convince his wives to leave Haran.

His statement that he fears Esau contrasts with the fear that he felt at Bethel after experiencing
God ([Genesis 28:17](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/17).) Who is it that he ultimately
fears? His list of those Esau might attack reveals his priorities: first himself, then the mothers,
and lastly, the children. This is reinforced (and reversed, somewhat) as the narrative continues.

At this point in the prayer, it appears that Jacob is trying to convince a god to whom he's not 
fully committed to protect him.[^14] It doesn't occur to him that Yahweh has full knowledge of his
heart and intentions. While Jacob perhaps has some hope in Yahweh, that it's fledgling at best is 
reinforced by his further action to protect himself immediately after he concludes his prayer.

Nevertheless, Jacob's final statement serves as assurance that God will protect Jacob.

> <sup>12</sup> “But you said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of
the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’”
>
> --Genesis 32:9–12 (ESV)

If Jacob doesn't survive this encounter, it would mean Yahweh failed to fulfill his promise,
something incompatible with God's nature as shown throughout Scripture. Yahweh’s commitment to his
promises—to rescue and protect his chosen line—demonstrates his unwavering faithfulness, even amid
Jacob’s faltering trust.[^15]

## Jacob's plan for protection

> <sup>13</sup> So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for
his brother Esau, <sup>14</sup> two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and
twenty rams, <sup>15</sup> thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty
female donkeys and ten male donkeys. <sup>16</sup> These he handed over to his servants, every drove
by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove.”
<sup>17</sup> He instructed the first, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, ‘To whom do you
belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?’ <sup>18</sup> then you shall say,
‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is
behind us.’ ” <sup>19</sup> He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the
droves, “You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him, <sup>20</sup> and you shall say,
‘Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.’” For he thought, “I may appease him with the present
that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”
<sup>21</sup> So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.
>
> --Genesis 32:13–21 (ESV)

Despite asking Yahweh to rescue him, Jacob decides to yet again take action to protect himself at
the expense of others. He sends 550 animals, an exceedingly lavish gift. There's a record of the
town of Hindanu paying the Assyrian king 110 animals as tribute in the 9th century B.C.[^16] By
dividing them into groups, Esau would have to stop multiple times to receive each one for
questioning and inspection, potentially slowing him down.[^17] Jacob positions himself at the back,
granting himself the greatest protection at the expense of others.

Other than the practical elements of Jacob's plan, there are many literary features in this passage.
"Present" is *minkhah*, which is very similar to *makheneh*, "camp" This signifies that Jacob's
actions are further proof that he doesn't trust in *makhanaim*, the "two camps," a heavenly camp
supporting the earthly one.[^18] *minkhah* is also the term used for the grain offering, which is
connected to first fruit offerings. Jacob offers it to Esau to "appease" him and so that Esau will
"accept" him. "Appease" and "accept" are terms used in connection with the burnt offering
([Leviticus 3:4](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/leviticus/3/4),) which served as a way to restore
a right relationship with God. While Jacob has wronged Esau, this terminology points to the one he
truly needs to make peace with.[^19]

There are also additional links to the flood story. Groups of male and female animals are sent to
Esau, reminiscent of God's command to Noah bring male and female animals into the ark
([Genesis 6:19](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/6/19).) Jacob instructs that "space" be set
between the groups. "Space" is *rewakh*, whose root, *rwkh* means "wind," "spirit," "breath," and is 
a peculiar word to designate space. A connection to the *rukha*, "wind" that God send to cause the
floodwaters to subside ([Genesis 8:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/8/1)) is likely.
Furthermore, the language of Jacob sending the "first," "second," and "third," droves is strikingly
similar to God's direction for Noah to build the ark with "lower, second, and third decks"
([Genesis 6:16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/6/16).)[^20] Taken together, these links give
the sense of Jacob constructing an "ark" as protection against the oncoming "flood" of Esau. He does
this on his own initiative, however, not at God's command.

Finally, there's an emphasis on "face." The word is used 7 times in this scene ("ahead of" in the 
ESV is literally "in front of/before my face".) The one Jacob next "faces" is the one he must truly
content with.

The scene ends with a final juxtaposition of "present," *minkhah*, and "camp," *makheneh*. The
episode has shown Jacob attending much more to his camps than trusting in the heavenly camp. He'll
next be forced to "strive" with the heavenly one.
