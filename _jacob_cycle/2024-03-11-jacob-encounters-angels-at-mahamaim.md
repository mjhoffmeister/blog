**The Jacob Cycle - Part 11**

Genesis 32:1-2 - As Jacob departs, he’s met by angels of God. So he sees angels of God leaving and entering the land. Mahanaim means “two camps.” This could mean that Jacob’s physical camp has a corresponding heavenly camp. There is no visual or verbal message, but as this is linked to Bethel, we’re probably meant to be reminded of God’s promise to be with Jacob and bring him back into the land.
