# Part 12 - Journey's end

The final scenes of the Jacob story have numerous references to what has come before. The Abraham
and Joseph stories end in a similar way, illustrating the intentional design of Genesis and 
reinforcing the idea that the stories of these generations elaborate on one another and are meant 
to be compared to get their full meaning.

## Return to Bethel

### Going up

> God said to Jacob, “**Arise**, **go up** to Bethel and **dwell (stay)** there. Make an altar 
there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”
>
> --Genesis 35:1 (ESV) [emphasis added]

> "Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. **Arise**, **flee** to Laban my brother in Haran and 
**stay** with him a while, until your brother’s fury turns away—"
>
> --Genesis 27:43-44 (ESV) [emphasis added]

When Rachel commanded Joseph to flee to Haran, she told him to “arise,” “flee,” and “stay.” At the 
end of the Jacob story, God commands Jacob to “arise,” “go up,” and “stay.” Jacob’s flight from the 
land is being reversed[^1].

Instead of fleeing, he “goes up” (*‘aleh*,) which has the same root word (*‘lh*) as “ascending”
(*‘olim*) in [Genesis 28:12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/12) where Jacob had the vision 
of angels ascending the stairway to heaven.

> And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to
heaven. And behold, the angels of God were **ascending (‘olim)** and descending on it!
>
> --Genesis 28:12 (ESV) [emphasis added]

The form of the verb "go up" is connected to pilgrimage elsewhere in the Bible (for example, 
[1 Samuel 1:3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1-samuel/1/3) and 
[Jeremiah 31:6](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/jeremiah/31/6)[^2].) He's returning to the land, to 
the house of God, *beth-el*, and the gate of heaven. God commands him to build an altar, which
reminds us of Jacob’s promise to worship God at the end of the Bethel scene in 
[Genesis 28:21-22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/28/21-22). Building an altar is a
reaffirmation his loyalty to Yahweh[^2].

## Foreign gods

> <sup>2</sup>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign 
gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments. <sup>3</sup>Then let us 
arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day 
of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.” <sup>4</sup>So they gave to Jacob all 
the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the 
terebinth tree that was near Shechem. 
>
> --Genesis 35:2-4

It’s likely that the foreign gods were acquired along with the people and possessions taken from 
the Hivites (see [Genesis 34:29](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/34/20)). Worship of other 
gods is incompatible with loyalty to Yahweh, so idols had to be purged from the community. 
Purification rituals found later in the Bible and are often connected to preparing oneself for 
encountering God. Changing clothes represents putting off an old way of life and taking up a new 
one. After the slaughter of the Hivite men, Jacob may have recognized the need for spiritual 
renewal before returning to Bethel[^3].
