## Introduction

- Sinai reveals how God draws near to His people and orders their life around His presence.
- Exodus 25–40 moves from God speaking on the mountain to God dwelling in the midst of the camp.
- The broad pattern of the text is creation (tabernacle instructions), de-creation (golden calf), and re-creation (construction).
- The tabernacle becomes Sinai in the camp, the place where the relationship between God and his people can be restored and where heaven and earth meet.
- In worship, the church reenacts this movement: God calls, cleanses, speaks, reveals His presence, and sends His people out with blessing, bearing His name.

## The Tabernacle as Reorientation

- Read: Exodus 25:1–7.
- Exodus 25–40 contains an unusually high concentration of Egyptian loanwords, especially for materials and craftsmanship, showing how deeply Israel's life in Egypt shaped both the items they used and the vocabulary they used to describe them.
- God does not erase Israel's past; He redirects it. What once served Pharaoh now serves the Lord who liberated them, and the sanctuary becomes the place where identity is reshaped.
- This reorientation prepares Israel to live as a people formed by God's presence and ordered by His worship.
- Reflection question: How does gathered worship today reorient our identity and redirect our service to God?

## The Tabernacle as a Reflection of Heavenly Reality

- Read: Exodus 25:8–9; Hebrews 9:24.
- Moses is repeatedly commanded to build the tabernacle "according to the pattern shown you on the mountain" (Exodus 25:9, 40; 26:30), grounding its design in the heavenly reality.
- Hebrews teaches that the true dwelling place is the heavenly tent, and the earthly sanctuary is a shadow of that reality.
- Revelation portrays the heavenly throne room with explicit tabernacle imagery: seven lamps before the throne, a sea like glass recalling the basin, incense rising before God, and the ark of the covenant appearing in the heavenly temple.
- Like Hebrews 12:18-29, the tabernacle shows that worship on earth participates in the heavenly worship God has unveiled.

## The Tabernacle as New Creation

- God gives the pattern for the tabernacle in seven distinct speeches to Moses with the phrase "And Yahweh said to Moses".
- Question: where else in Scripture does the number seven structure God's work in a foundational way?
- The tabernacle's architecture reflects the ordered world: the tent corresponds to the heavens stretched out like a curtain, the veil mirrors the firmament, the lampstand corresponds to the lights of day four, the high priest corresponds to humanity on day six, and the completion and blessing of the work echo Genesis 2:1–3.
- One of craftsman appointed for the work, Bezalel, is said to be filled with the Spirit of God, the exact phrase from Genesis 1:2, showing that the same Spirit who brought order and life at creation now empowers the building of God's dwelling and marks the tabernacle as an act of new creation.
- Reflection question: how does the idea of assembling the church as "new creation" shape our understanding of what God is doing in our gatherings?

## The Tabernacle's Meaning in Its Parts

- The ark: it stands in the Most Holy Place as the focal point of God's presence, the closest point of approach between heaven and earth.
- The cherubim above the lid recall Eden's guardians, signaling restored access (though mediated) to God and forming the throne from which He rules His people.
- The atonement lid (*kappōret*) shares its root with *kipper* ("to make atonement") and with the pitch (*kōpher*) that sealed Noah's ark, linking atonement with covering, protection, and deliverance.
- Paul's claim that God sent His Son to be a "propitiation" through His blood refers to the place of atonement in the Holy of Holies (Romans 3:25), showing that Jesus provides the atonement needed to enter the direct presence of God.
- The bread table: Israel kept the table but overturned its ancient Near Eastern meaning: the bread was not food for God but a weekly sign of dependence and gratitude, *lechem pānîm* ("bread of the face"), symbolizing life lived before God's nearness.
- Jesus fulfills the table's symbolism as the true bread from heaven (John 6:32–35), the divine provision anticipated in both manna and the bread set before God, so that in gathered worship God's people are nourished not by food offered to Him but by His provision offered to them
- The lampstand: it evokes the tree of life and shines continually to mark the way toward God, fulfilled in Christ as the true light who guides His people into God's presence in gathered worship.
- The tabernacle materials: the tabernacle's materials and colors map Israel's approach to God: linen in the courtyard, then blue, purple, and crimson as one moves inward, with cherubim embroidered on the innermost veil, visually marking increasing holiness.
- The bronze altar: The *ʿōlāh* offered on the bronze altar recalls earlier acts of devotion and restored relationship in Scripture, from Noah's offering after the flood to Abraham's offering on Moriah, showing that Israel's daily sacrifices stand in continuity with God's long established pattern of atonement and trust.
- These continual offerings anticipate the once for all sacrifice of Jesus, who through His own blood secured eternal redemption (Hebrews 10:11-14), so that in gathered worship the ascent toward God begins not with repeated offerings but with the finished work of Christ.
- The courtyard: The courtyard marks the starting point of approach, where worshipers enter from the east and symbolically reverse the direction of exile, beginning the ascent through atonement and cleansing by God's gracious invitation to return.
- The priests: the priests fill sacred space. Their clothing mirrors the tabernacle: linen corresponds to the courtyard, blue and purple and crimson correspond to the Holy Place, and gold corresponds to the Most Holy Place. Jesus enables us to enter sacred space as the priests did (Hebrews 10:19–22).
- The consecration rite reenacts Israel's exodus through sacrifice, washing, anointing, and commissioning, forming the priests through the same pattern of deliverance that brought the nation into covenant life with God.
- The gate: the altar of incense, the census ransom, the wash basin, the anointing oil, and the incense form the door to sacred space, each one tied to atonement so that intercession, ransom, cleansing, and consecration together secure safe passage from common ground into the presence of the Holy One.

## Rupture and Intercession

- Read: Exodus 32:1, 4, 9-14, 19, 33:5
- The golden calf is a de-creation event. While Moses receives the heavenly blueprint on the mountain, Israel forms an earthly image below, reversing the direction of true worship.
- The covenant is broken and the tablets are shattered, signaling a rupture that threatens Israel's fellowship with God. Moses intercedes, and God relents from destroying Israel.
- Israel becomes stiff‑necked, rigid and unyielding like the metal calf they have fashioned (Exodus 32:9; 33:5). Worship shapes the worshiper (Psalm 115:1-8).
- Reflection question: in what created things do we place our hope for rescue instead of trusting the God of rescue?

## Covenant Renewal

- Read: Exodus 34:1, 11-14, 29-30
- After the golden calf, the covenant had been broken. The shattered tablets testified to Israel's unfaithfulness, but the new tablets testify to a covenant renewed by grace and to fellowship restored.
- The renewal begins with a call to careful obedience. Moses is told to *shamar*, guard/keep what he receives, echoing Genesis 2:15. Israel must guard the covenant with undivided loyalty and resist the practices that had just drawn them into false worship.
- Moses's shining face becomes a deliberate reversal of the calf. The verb for his radiance, *qāran*, is related to *qeren*, "horn," the imagery that would have marked the calf as a horned, power‑bearing idol. Israel had credited that horned image with their deliverance; now the intercessor descends bearing God's own "horned" glory, restoring honor to its rightful source.
- The Lord then reaffirms the proper rhythms of Israel's worship. The people had invented their own festival during the calf episode, so God restates the appointed festivals and rituals that shape Israel's life with Him and sustain covenant fellowship.
- The Day of Atonement later provides the ongoing renewal Israel needs, as the high priest alone enters the Holy of Holies each year to cleanse both the people and God's dwelling from the impurity that continually threatens their nearness to His presence. Hebrews teaches that this pattern ultimately points to Christ, who has entered the true Holy of Holies once for all on our behalf (Hebrews 9:11–12, 24).

## Blessing

- Read: Exodus 40:33b–38
- With the glory filling the completed tabernacle, God takes up residence among His people. The tabernacle becomes a portable Sinai, the meeting place of heaven and earth, and God's presence is meant to radiate outward in life giving blessing.
- Read: Numbers 6:24-26
- The priestly blessing of Numbers 6, given by God at Sinai, extends the shining face of God from the sanctuary to the people. Through priestly mediation the Lord places His name upon Israel, declaring protection, grace, and peace as the radiance of His presence enters their life together.
- This blessing completes Israel's worship and echoes Psalm 24, where those who ascend the Lord's hill receive both blessing and a verdict of righteousness. The blessing functions as God's public declaration that His people stand under His favor.

## Conclusion

- The tabernacle shows that God draws near to dwell with His people, reshaping their identity, ordering their worship, and forming them as a community centered on His presence.
- Every movement of the tabernacle narrative points forward to Christ, the true mediator and high priest, who brings His people into the heavenly reality the earthly sanctuary only foreshadowed.
- In gathered worship today, the church reenacts the same pattern of covenant renewal as God calls, cleanses, instructs, welcomes, and blesses His people, sending them out bearing His name as those restored by grace.
