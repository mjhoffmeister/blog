## Introduction

- Ezekiel saw a renewed mountain and a restored people gathered around God's presence. Revelation unveils that same reality from heaven's perspective, showing the worship that shapes the church now and the worship that will fill creation in the end.
- John is carried to a great, high mountain to see the holy city, revealing the final horizon where heaven and earth reunite and Eden is restored.
- The church's worship now becomes a foretaste and rehearsal of that future, shaping our desires toward the world God is bringing.

## Worship as Counter Formation

- Read: Revelation 1:9
- John writes to churches under Rome, the latest power to claim the center of reality. He receives his vision on Patmos, far from Rome's monumental cities, and the risen Christ appears among lampstands representing the churches.
- Rome trained its cities to teach worship. Imperial temples dominated the skyline. Festivals reinforced Rome as the center of reality.
- Reflection question: what spaces, rhythms, and rituals in our culture train us to see something other than God as the center of reality?
- Into this world, Christ speaks: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, the Living One. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and Hades."
- Every claim Rome made, Revelation reassigns. Rome claimed the center; Revelation will show God's throne is the center. Caesar claimed to mediate heaven and earth; Christ is the real mediator. The empire claimed to hold the world together; Yahweh is creator and sustainer.

## Summons to the Throne

- Read: Revelation 2:14, 2:20
- Some believers were already negotiating their place within Rome's order. Revelation responds with a vision of the higher reality that should be shaping the church's life.
- Read: Revelation 4:1-6
- Check question: what elements from previous lessons do you recognize in the initial scene around God's throne?
- A door stands open in heaven and John is summoned upward, echoing Ezekiel's repeated experiences of being carried in the Spirit to see God's visions. At the center of this heavenly space is a throne, and everything is arranged around it. All inhabitants of the earth are evaluated by their response to the one who sits on it.
- When the church gathers, we enter the presence of the one seated on the throne. Worship aligns us with the highest reality and forms us according to the order of the heavenly sanctuary.

## Worship Before the Holy One

- Read: Revelation 4:8-11
- The living creatures declare: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming." The final clause points forward to God's definitive arrival.
- The elders cast their crowns before the throne and confess God as creator and sustainer. Their praise echoes Daniel, where God's everlasting dominion stands against the fleeting reigns of kings who exalt themselves.
- Read: Daniel 4:34-35
- Reflection question: what are we declaring about the powers of our age every time we worship God as the eternal King?

## The Lamb and the Scroll

- Read: Revelation 5:1-5
- A scroll appears in God's right hand, sealed with seven seals. An angel asks who is worthy to open it. If no one can, God's purpose for history will not unfold. No judgment, justice, or new creation. Hearing God's word has been established as a goal of ascending the mountain.
- Read: Revelation 5:6-10
- In Ezekiel's temple, the altar stands at the center of the sanctuary. Here, the slain Lamb occupies that center. He stands where the sacrifice belongs.
- The living creatures and elders sing a new song. "New" signals new creation. The song interprets the Lamb's worthiness: he was slain, he purchased a people from every tribe and tongue, he made them a kingdom and priests, Israel's title from Sinai. What Rome claimed through conquest, the Lamb accomplishes through sacrifice.
- Read: Revelation 5:11-14
- Countless angels take up the song, then every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and in the sea joins one declaration. Worship expands in concentric waves. Heaven and earth unite in an act of worship directed to God and the Lamb as one.
- Reflection question: how does joining this heavenly reality reshape the way you understand our worship gatherings?

## The Song of the Nations

- Read: Revelation 7:9-12
- A massive assembly from every nation, tribe, people, and tongue stands before the throne, clothed in white robes and holding palm branches. The palm branches evoke Israel's Feast of Tabernacles, the celebration of God's faithfulness through the wilderness. This gathering keeps a heavenly Tabernacles, celebrating the completion of their pilgrimage into God's presence.
- This is the redeemed community from chapter five, now seen in fullness. In 5:10, they received Israel's title from Sinai: a kingdom and priests. On Mount Moriah, God promised Abraham descendants beyond numbering and declared that through him all nations would be blessed. Here, they have been made a part of Israel itself.
- Reflection question: how does this vision of worship reshape the way we think about "us" and "them" in our own cultural moment?

## The Measured Temple

- Read: Revelation 11:1-2
- John is given a measuring rod and told to measure the temple, the altar, and those who worship there. As in Ezekiel 40-48, to measure is to mark sacred space and reorder reality.
- The outer court is left unmeasured and given to the nations. The measured sanctuary represents God's people preserved in faith. The unmeasured court represents the same community exposed to earthly harm. The measuring guarantees not the absence of suffering but the security of worship.

## The Song of the Kingdom

- Read: Revelation 11:15-19
- After the seventh trumpet sounds, heaven declares: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever." This is accomplished fact, spoken from heaven's vantage where the end is certain.
- The elders fall on their faces. Earlier in Revelation, God is "who is, who was, and who is to come." Here the final phrase changes: "you have taken your great power and have begun to reign." Heaven no longer speaks of God as the one coming but as the one who has acted.
- The proclamation draws on the Song of Moses in Exodus 15, sung after Israel passed through the sea. The first six trumpets echoed the exodus plagues. The seventh reaches their destination: the song of the redeemed in God's presence. The heavenly temple opens and the ark of the covenant appears, declaring that atonement is complete and God's innermost sanctuary stands revealed.

## The New Song on Mount Zion

- Read: Revelation 14:1-5
- The Lamb stands as king on Mount Zion with 144,000 who bear his and the Father's name on their foreheads. They are the counter-image to the mark of the beast (666; Revelation 13:16-18), signifying the completeness of God's people throughout the ages.
- They sing a new song, again signaling new creation, before the throne, and no one can learn it except those redeemed from the earth. Their song celebrates the Lamb's victory and their entrance into it through loyalty.
- Read: Revelation 15:2-4
- Those who conquered the beast stand beside a sea of glass and sing the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb. Israel sang on the far shore of the Red Sea. Now the redeemed stand on the far side of a greater deliverance.
- The seven bowls that follow are modeled on the plagues of Egypt. This is a final exodus and Babylon and Satan are defeated. The church has passed through the waters and assembled on Mount Zion. Its song looks forward to the moment all nations come to the mountain of God.
- Reflection question: if our worship is a new song that can only be sung by those shaped through loyalty, what is forming in us that the world cannot produce on its own?

## The New Jerusalem

- Read: Revelation 21:1-4
- The holy city descends, prepared as a bride. A voice from the throne: God will dwell with his people, echoing Ezekiel 37 and 43. But in Ezekiel, the city and the temple were separate; the temple stood to the north, outside the city walls. Now city and temple are one.
- Read: Revelation 21:10, 15
- Also as in Ezekiel, an angel measures the city. In chapter eleven, only the inner court was measured. Now all is measured and secured.
- Read: Revelation 22:1-5
- From the throne flows a river of the water of life. Ezekiel 47 saw a river flowing from beneath the temple which echoed the river that went out of Eden. On either side of the river stands the tree of life, the same tree offered in Eden. The end returns to the beginning.

## Conclusion

- To worship the one on the throne and the Lamb is to live in the world as God ordered it. False worship aligns us with the false ordering of Babylon. True worship is alignment with heavenly reality.
- When believers gather, they come to the Mount Zion Hebrews describes: the heavenly Jerusalem, the joyful assembly, and Jesus the mediator of a new covenant. They join the song of the redeemed from every nation.
- The story began in a garden on a mountain. Revelation shows that the worship for which humanity was made has never ceased. The descending city is the final mountain where God is seen and all is made whole. Our worship now is a foretaste of that world.
