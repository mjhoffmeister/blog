Mount Sinai stands at the center of Israel's story as the place where God gathers his redeemed people, speaks his word, and forms them into a holy nation. Through the exodus from Egypt, the passage through the Sea of Reeds, and the journey to the mountain, God transforms Israel from slaves serving Pharaoh into a kingdom of priests serving the Lord at his dwelling place.

## Summary

In this lesson, we explore how God leads Israel from bondage to worship at Sinai. Moses, preserved through the waters and first to ascend the mountain, becomes God's chosen deliverer who opens the way for his people to follow. Through the Passover lamb's blood, Israel is spared from judgment. Through the Sea of Reeds, they pass from death to life in a new creation. At Sinai, God speaks the covenant that forms them into his treasured possession, and Moses sprinkles the blood of the covenant that binds God to Israel and Israel to God. The pattern established at Sinai finds its fulfillment in Christ, the greater Moses, whose blood establishes the new covenant and whose people gather at the heavenly Mount Zion to worship.
