Revelation unveils the true center of the cosmos—the throne of God and the Lamb—and calls the church to resist every counterfeit claim to worship by participating in the heavenly liturgy that will one day fill the new creation.

## Summary

In this lesson, we explore how Revelation presents the worship of heaven as the true ordering of the cosmos. Against the backdrop of Roman imperial claims, John's visions relocate the center of reality in the throne room where God and the Lamb receive the praise of living creatures, elders, angels, and a vast multitude from every nation. The Lamb's sacrificial death opens the scroll of history, the martyrs rest beneath the heavenly altar, and the redeemed stand on Mount Zion singing a new song. Babylon falls, and the New Jerusalem descends as a city-temple where God dwells with his people forever. When the church gathers for worship today, it ascends to this same Mount Zion and participates in the heavenly reality that will one day fill all creation.
