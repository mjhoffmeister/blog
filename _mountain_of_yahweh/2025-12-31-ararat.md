## Summary

In this lesson, we explore how the flood becomes a passage through judgment into safety on the mountain. Noah's journey through the waters—entering the ark, surviving the flood, and ascending to worship on Ararat—establishes the pattern for God's people approaching Him through baptism and gathering for worship. In Christ, the greater Noah, the church passes through the waters and ascends the heavenly mountain to offer praise and receive covenant blessing.
