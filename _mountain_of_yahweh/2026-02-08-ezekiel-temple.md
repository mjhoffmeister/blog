From exile in Babylon, Ezekiel receives a vision of a restored temple on a very high mountain—a sanctuary measured in jubilee proportions, where God's glory returns to dwell among His people forever. The vision reorders Israel's worship, land, and life around God's presence at the center and sends a river of life flowing outward into a world awaiting renewal.

## Summary

In this lesson, we follow Ezekiel's vision of the restored temple from the valley of dry bones to the river of life. After God's glory departs the corrupted temple in judgment, the Spirit breathes new life into dead Israel and defeats Gog, the final enemy, clearing the path to God's mountain. Ezekiel is set on a very high mountain at a time marked by jubilee symbolism—the midpoint of exile, the Day of Atonement—where a radiant guide reveals the heavenly blueprint for worship. The temple's massive eastern gates, ascending stairways, and concentric courts draw the worshiper upward through graded zones of holiness toward the altar at the exact center, the mountain-summit where God meets His people through sacrifice. The interior echoes Eden in its carved cherubim and palm trees, yet it contains no gold, no ark, and no lampstand—only a table set before the Lord, awaiting His return. When the glory of the Lord enters from the east, the gate closes behind Him: He has come to stay. The vision then extends outward as holiness shapes priestly service, princely governance, honest commerce, festival rhythms, and the land itself, all ordered around God's dwelling. A river flows from beneath the temple threshold, deepening as it goes, transforming death into life wherever it reaches. The city at the vision's end is named *Yahweh šāmmâ*—"the Lord is there"—a confession that God's presence is the destination of all pilgrimage. In assembled worship, the church stands in the reality Ezekiel foresaw: gathered as the living temple of God, ascending Mount Zion through Christ, and becoming the channel through which His life flows into the world.
