Solomon's temple rises on Mount Moriah, uniting Abraham's obedience, David's altar, and the tabernacle's design into a permanent dwelling for God among His people. Yet even as the ascent reaches its height, the seeds of a return to Egypt are quietly sown, showing that no human king can secure what only Christ will complete.

## Summary

In this lesson, we trace Solomon's construction of the temple on Mount Moriah, from its preparation through its dedication and the king's eventual fall. The temple's literary design echoes creation in its seven-year construction, its garden imagery of carved cedar, cherubim, and open blossoms, and the completion language that links it to Genesis 1. At the heart of the construction narrative, God's word interrupts to declare that His presence rests on obedience, not architectural splendor—a warning Israel will later forget and Jeremiah will confront. The furnishings gather familiar sacred-space imagery, while Solomon's seven-part dedication prayer anticipates Israel's failure and petitions for grace. Yet a return-to-Egypt trajectory quietly develops: forced labor echoes Pharaoh's oppression, Pharaoh's daughter sits at the structural center of the palace narrative, and Solomon accumulates precisely what the law warned kings to avoid. His divided heart leads to rival high places ringing the mountain of the Lord, and the kingdom is torn. Still, God preserves a remnant for the sake of David and Jerusalem. Jesus emerges as the better Solomon, the faithful builder whose unshakable kingdom ensures that the return to Egypt is undone and God's dwelling with His people will never be corrupted.
