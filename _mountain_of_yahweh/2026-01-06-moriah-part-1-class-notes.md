## Introduction

*   Mount Moriah is the site where the temple would later stand, divinely prepared for worship. Scripture identifies Moriah with Zion, the sacred city of Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 3:1; Psalm 76:2).
*   Genesis anticipates worship on Zion and points forward to the New Jerusalem prepared by Jesus (John 14:2–3).
*   When believers gather on Mount Zion today, they ascend spiritually into God's presence, being prepared for the eternal gathering described in Revelation 21:1.
*   We will explore two key narratives around Moriah:
    *   A battle of nations sets the backdrop for Abram's encounter with Melchizedek in Salem (Genesis 14), which anticipates Moriah and shows blessing through worship.
    *   Abraham's test on Moriah (Genesis 22) climaxes in obedience and God's provision, echoing earlier family tensions and pointing to covenantal presence.

## The Flood of Violence

*   Genesis 14 begins with a battle between the kings of Canaan and those of Mesopotamia, east of Canaan.
*   Their names create a portrait of the world away from God's presence.
*   Read: Genesis 14:1–7.
*   The eastern kings are Amraphel (might mean "Speaker of Darkness" or "Servant of Amurru [an Amorite god]"), Arioch ("lion-like", evoking a wilderness predator), Chedorlaomer ("Servant of Lagamar," a deity whose name means "the unsparing"), and Tidal ("evil offspring", in contrast with the chosen offspring of Abram).
*   The Canaanite kings opposing Abram and Lot also bear corrupt names: Bara ("In Evil"), Birsha ("In Wickedness"), Shinab ("Father Hater"), Shemeber ("Name of Destruction"), Bela ("Devoured").
*   The battle occurs in the Valley of Siddim, possibly linked to *shedim*, rebellious spiritual beings, a stage where human violence and spiritual rebellion converge.
*   Reflection question: what do the names of these kings suggest about kingdoms separated from God?
*   As we have seen in previous lessons, before ascending the mountain to worship, the waters of chaos must be crossed.
*   Read: Genesis 14:8–11.
*   The eastern kings strike the Rephaim and other giant clans (Genesis 14:5), later linked with the Anakim and Nephilim (Deuteronomy 2:10–11; Numbers 13:33).
    *   (*nakah*, "strike"): Genesis 14:5 — Eastern kings strike the Rephaim; Genesis 8:21 — God vows not to strike all flesh again after the flood. Same verb links human conquest with divine judgment.
*   The kings fall into the pits, swallowed as if by floodwaters, while survivors flee to the mountains, echoing Noah's refuge on Ararat (Genesis 8:4).
    *   (*ʾarubbot*, "windows"): Genesis 7:11 — floodwaters burst from heaven's *ʾarubbot*; Genesis 14:10 — the Valley of Siddim filled with *beʾerot* ("pits"). The consonants form an anagram, tying destructive openings above to destructive openings below.
*   The beginning of Genesis 14 portrays the clash of kings as a flood of violence.

## Rescue and Return

*   Read: Genesis 14:12–16.
*   Lot is captured and carried into exile, setting the stage for Abraham's intercession in Sodom. Twice Abraham restores Lot: here by military rescue, later by prayer.
*   Abram pursues the kings with 318 men, defeats them, and rescues Lot. His victory anticipates Christ's greater deliverance from sin and death.
*   Abram is joined by Mamre, Aner, and Eshkol, "those bound by treaty" (Genesis 14:13), pictured as covenant allies in a mini Eden. Eshkol means "Grape Cluster," recalling fruitfulness.
*   Abram's victory points to Christ's triumph, leading His people to Mount Zion through the waters, where worship becomes the ascent of the rescued community into communion with the Father.
*   After Abram's victory, the scene shifts to Jerusalem, where the temple would later stand on Mount Moriah.
*   Read: Genesis 14:17–24.
*   Melchizedek is the tenth king in the narrative, and the word "blessed" is repeated three times.
    *   Note: some translations use "praise" instead of "blessed" in verse 20, but the word is the same as in verses 18 and 19.
*   Check question: from our previous lessons, what has been significant about the number 10 and a three-fold blessing?
*   Being the tenth king recalls the ten words of creation. His threefold blessing mirrors the three blessings of Genesis 1–2. Abram's encounter with Melchizedek is framed as a new creation moment.
*   The offering of bread and wine is an act of hospitality, but also points to the priestly act of grain and drink offerings (Exodus 29:40; Numbers 15:5–10) and the Feast of Weeks where bread and wine offerings were made.
    *   Deep dive: the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) was originally a thanksgiving festival for God's provision at the end of the grain harvest. As it occurs fifty days after Passover, it also aligns with Israel's arrival at Mount Sinai where they ratified a covenant with God and received His word.
*   By giving Melchizedek a tithe of the spoils of war, Abram signals his loyalty to Yahweh and his rejection of the corrupt powers of the land.
*   The king of Sodom demands, "Give me people; take property yourself".
*   Abram refuses Sodom's offer, reversing the "taking" of Genesis 3. In assembled worship, blessing is received as divine gift, not seized by human effort.
*   This episode transforms military victory into spiritual ascent: Abram attributes success to God Most High, and the rescued community gathers in worship to bless Him for deliverance.
*   Psalms connect Zion with Melchizedek (Psalm 76:2; 110:4), and Hebrews identifies Jesus as the eternal priest in this order (Hebrews 7).
*   We gather in worship on Mount Zion because Jesus has led us through the flood of sin and death, bringing us into God's presence to receive His blessing.

## Testing on Moriah

*   After Abram's encounter with Melchizedek, Abraham's dealings with the nations revealed wavering trust.
    *   Sarah gave Hagar (her name means "immigrant") to Abraham; Ishmael was born, and both were mistreated — a failure to bless the nations.
    *   In Gerar, Abraham admitted to Abimelech, "I thought there is no fear of God in this place" (Genesis 20:11), showing fear of the nations more than fear of God.
    *   Instead of being a source of blessing, Abraham and Sarah brought harm and distrust.
    *   On Mount Moriah, God reverses these failures.
*   Read: Genesis 22:1–18.
*   "The God" tested Abraham (Genesis 22:1), not "God" or "Yahweh," perhaps signaling distance. After ascending the mountain, Abraham encounters Yahweh, who blessed him again.
*   Genesis 22 links directly with Genesis 21. Abraham "rose early in the morning" in both accounts. Ishmael was expelled; Isaac is commanded to be sacrificed. Food and water were taken for Ishmael; wood and fire are taken for Isaac. Both sons face death until God intervenes. In both stories, God "sees": He saw Hagar in her distress (Genesis 21:17–19), and He "sees to" the substitute sacrifice for Isaac (Genesis 22:8, 13–14).
*   Abraham is commanded to offer Isaac as a burnt offering, the *ʿōlâ* or "ascension offering," the same kind Noah gave after the flood (Genesis 8:20), symbolizing complete devotion and atonement. When Isaac asks, "Where is the lamb?" Abraham replies, "God himself will provide." In assembled worship, the church answers with Christ, who offered Himself once for all (Hebrews 10:10–12).
*   At the climax, Abraham raises the knife, but God stops him. A ram appears, caught in a thicket, and is offered in Isaac's place.
*   Read: Genesis 3:6.
*   Reflection question: in Eden, Eve saw, took, and gave the fruit, which brought curse. On Moriah, Abraham also sees and takes. What is different about his response?
    *   On Moriah, Abraham reverses Eden. Where Eve saw, took, and grasped bringing curse, Abraham saw, took, and offered bringing blessing. Worship reorients human response from grasping like the world to offering in faith, opening the way to life.
*   The angel of the LORD calls to Abraham from heaven, just as He once called to Hagar when her son was near death (Genesis 21:17). Abraham's fear of the nations is reoriented into fear of Yahweh.
*   After the sacrifice, the covenant is renewed. God promises descendants as numerous as stars and sand and adds that Abraham's offspring will possess the gate of their enemies (Genesis 22:17). Paul cites this promise to show that Christ is the ultimate descendant (Galatians 3:16).
*   Abraham's willingness to give his "one and only son" anticipates God's gift of His Son (John 3:16). Worship is the meeting of human loyalty and divine mercy, securing blessing for the gathered community.
*   Gathered on Mount Zion for worship, God undoes the damage caused by our failure to show His love. We reaffirm our relationship with Him, and He graciously blesses us again.

## Conclusion

*   Moriah is prepared as the place where blessing is given, the failures of God's people are overturned, and a substitutionary sacrifice is offered for those failures.
*   The covenant is renewed through God's will and Abraham's tested obedience, anticipating Christ's perfect obedience that opens the way into God's presence through worship.
*   Worship reorients the community away from the ways of the world toward God's presence, fulfilled in Christ and preparing the church for the New Jerusalem.
