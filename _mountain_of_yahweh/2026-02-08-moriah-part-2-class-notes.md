## Introduction

- Solomon's reign brings the Sinai to Zion journey to its summit as the temple rises on Mount Moriah, uniting Abraham's obedience, David's altar, and Solomon's work into one line of God's unfolding story.
- The temple marks the shift from wandering to settled rest and anticipates the church's final arrival at the New Jerusalem, where God dwells with his people forever.
- Even as the ascent reaches its height, a return to Egypt trajectory quietly develops through Pharaoh's daughter, forced labor, and foreign alliances, showing that nearness to sacred space does not guarantee faithfulness.

## Preparation for the Temple

- Read: 1 Kings 5:1–5
- Solomon stands as the ideal king to build the Lord's house, ruling a kingdom marked by peace and equipped with God‑given wisdom.
- David could not build because his reign was marked by warfare; a sanctuary for the God of peace required a king whose rule embodied rest.
- Reflection question: why would peace and stability be essential for building God's house?
- A sanctuary for the God of peace required a king whose rule was marked by rest rather than conflict, pointing forward to the New Jerusalem where God's sabbath rest is eternal.
- Read: 1 Kings 5:8-9a, 13-16
- The narrator highlights Solomon's use of *mas* (forced labor) and describes the workers with ʿābad (to serve).
- Question: where else have we read of forced labor and servitude?
- Solomon's use of *mas* (forced labor) and *ʿābad* (to serve) echoes Israel's oppression in Egypt and the compromises of Judges, revealing that the methods used to build God's house already carry the logic of Egypt.

## The Literary Design of the Temple's Construction

- Read: 1 Kings 6:1
- The temple's construction echoes the exodus and frames the building as the midpoint between Egypt and Baylon, the place where Israel's ascent toward God reaches its height.
- The repeated use of kalah ("to complete") links the temple to creation, marking it as a small‑scale picture of the world where heaven and earth meet.
- At the center of the chapter stands God's word (1 Kings 6:11–13), the condition for his presence among his people.
- The narrative's interruption with Solomon's palace projects exposes the tension in his priorities and anticipates that no mere human leader can bring God's people fully into his presence, only Jesus, the true Son of David, can.

## The Temple Exterior

- Read: 1 Kings 6:2, 4-9a
- The temple was 60x20x30 cubits and it included side chambers (*ṣēlāʿ*).
- Question: where else have we seen something built from a side in sacred space?
- The term first appears in Genesis 2, where God builds the woman from Adam's *ṣēlāʿ* in a narrative already shaped by sanctuary imagery. It also appears in the tabernacle instructions of Exodus 25 and Exodus 26.
- The architectural details also recall the ark narrative—windows, doors, three levels, and the verb *kālāh* ("finish")—linking the temple to God's work of preserving life.
- The three‑tiered structure mirrors the heavenly temple in Ezekiel 41, showing a consistent biblical design for God's house.
- The exterior gathers these images into a stable, God‑built structure that shelters a people and signals his intention to renew the world through his presence.

## Yahweh's Word

- Read: 1 Kings 6:11–13
- In the middle of the construction report, Yahweh speaks—the climactic moment on every biblical mountain—declaring that his presence rests on obedience, not architectural splendor.
- Israel later confused the building with the reality, treating the temple as a guarantee of safety, a false confidence Jeremiah confronts in Jeremiah 7.
- Read: Jeremiah 7:1–7
- The warning casts a long shadow: the temple will be stripped and burned because the people refuse to heed God's voice.
- For assembled worship today, the ascent of God's people is secured not by structures or practices but by believing loyalty to Jesus, whose word shapes us into a new creation.
- Reflection question: do you trust more in a correct order of worship than in believing loyalty to Jesus, the one who makes true assembled worship possible?
- The church ascends by trusting God and receiving his word with open ears and responsive hearts, expressing and renewing loyalty as he shapes us into a new creation.

## The Temple Interior

- Read: 1 Kings 6:15, 18, 22–23, 29, 33–34a, 35, 38b
- Question: which symbols in the temple interior echo sacred space from earlier lessons
- Like Moses with the tabernacle, Solomon follows a pattern that reaches back to Eden, the first place where God dwelled with humanity.
- The interior is lined with cedar and cypress, every surface carved with plant life, gourds, flowers, and open blossoms, recalling the tabernacle's embroidered garden imagery, now rendered in wood.
- The cherubim that once guarded the way back into Eden stand over the ark with wings outstretched, gathering the garden images into a single space that symbolically brings the worshiper back into the life and joy humanity lost through sin.
- The work takes seven years to complete, recalling the seven days of creation and echoing the pattern used in the tabernacle's construction.

## Human Houses

- Read: 1 Kings 7:1–2, 8–12
- Reflection question: what impression are you left with after reading the descriptions of God's house and the houses of Solomon and Pharaoh's daughter?
- The same verbs describe both projects, but the king's house receives more time, more attention, and far more material glory.
- At the structural center of the temple building narrative stands the palace for Pharaoh's daughter, and at the center of that palace description stands Pharaoh's daughter herself.
- This placement exposes Solomon's divided loyalty: the woman who represents his alliance with Egypt sits at the heart of his most sacred work.
- The narrative presses a searching question on worshipers: whose house are we most eager to build
- Solomon's growing preoccupation with his own house will eventually lead him toward the worship of other gods; the seeds of that decline are planted here in the quiet contrast between the two building projects and the loyalties they reveal.

## The Temple Furnishings

- Read: 1 Kings 7:13-14, 15a, 18, 23a, 24, 26, 28-29a, 48-49a
- Hiram is introduced with the same triad of "wisdom, understanding, and knowledge" used of Bezalel in the tabernacle narrative, signaling continuity with the wilderness pattern of skilled, God‑given craftsmanship without repeating the final step that marked Bezalel's work.
- The furnishings gather familiar sacred‑space imagery: threshold‑marking pillars, a creation‑ordering sea, Eden‑like vegetation, and cherubim that signal guarded divine presence.
- Solomon's contribution of gold items hints at a growing preoccupation with gold itself, a desire for abundance and display that will later expose a heart drifting toward wealth and royal splendor rather than undivided loyalty.

## The Temple Dedication

- Read: 1 Kings 8:11b, 22-23, 27-30
- Solomon offers a seven‑part prayer that anticipates Israel's failure from the outset, moving quickly from a call to obedience to repeated petitions for forgiveness and restoration, showing that the temple, God's mountain in miniature, is a place where judgment is real but grace has the final word.
- Read: John 17:24
- Jesus' prayer in John 17:24 follows Solomon's dedication pattern, asking the Father to grant the son's presence to his followers and reveal his eternal glory, thereby dedicating his church as the new temple where God's Name and glory dwell.

## Solomon's Fall

- Read: Deuteronomy 17:14–17; 1 Samuel 8:10–12; 1 Kings 9:15a, 20–22; 10:14–17, 26–28
- Reflection question: how does Solomon's reign after the construction of the temple compare to the earlier passages about Israel's kings?
- Solomon accumulates wealth, horses, and chariots—precisely what the law warned kings not to do, especially in connection with Egypt.
- His building projects resemble the structures of Egypt, suggesting that Israel is becoming an Egypt in character even while remaining in the land.
- Read: 1 Kings 11:1–2, 7
- Solomon's heart becomes divided. The verbs describing his attachment to foreign women echo Deuteronomy's language for Israel's loyalty to God.
- In old age, his wives turn his heart toward other gods. The king who prayed that God would incline Israel's heart cannot keep his own heart from drifting.
- The mountain of the Lord becomes ringed with rival high places as Solomon builds shrines for the gods of his wives.
- Read: 1 Kings 11:9–13
- God announces judgment: the kingdom will be torn from Solomon's son.
- Yet mercy remains. One tribe will stay for the sake of David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city God has chosen.

## Conclusion

- Solomon's ascent to the mountain ends in failure, showing that even the king who built the temple can lead Israel toward a new Egypt, yet God remains faithful and preserves a remnant for the sake of his promise.
- Jesus is the better builder whose faithfulness, not ours, opens the way into God's presence and establishes a temple that cannot be corrupted or shaken.
- The spiritual Mount Zion stands because a better Solomon reigns; in Jesus, the return to Egypt is being undone, and his unshakable kingdom will reach its fullness when the new Jerusalem descends and God dwells with his people forever.
