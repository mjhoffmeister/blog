Mount Moriah holds a unique place in the biblical story as the divinely prepared place of worship where the temple would one day stand. Through Abram's encounter with Melchizedek and Abraham's test on the mountain, Genesis anticipates the worship centered on Zion and points forward to Christ, who prepares us for eternal gathering with God.

## Summary

In this lesson, we explore how Mount Moriah is prepared as the place of covenant blessing. Abram's victory over the kings and encounter with Melchizedek in Jerusalem (Genesis 14) establishes worship as the meeting point between God and His people. Abraham's test on Moriah (Genesis 22) reverses the failures of Eden through obedient sacrifice, with God providing a substitute that anticipates Christ. When the church gathers for worship today, we ascend Mount Zion spiritually, receiving the blessing secured by Christ's perfect obedience and substitutionary sacrifice.
