## Introduction

- Ezekiel prophesied during the Babylonian exile, when Israel was displaced from their land and temple, grappling with the loss of God's presence due to covenant unfaithfulness.
- Ezekiel has a vision of the temple that exposes the failures of Solomon and later kings, contrasting their corrupted worship with a restored future shaped by Yahweh's presence.
- Read: Ezekiel 8:1-4
- Following this, Ezekiel's guide shows Israel worshipping idols, other gods, and the sun in the temple.
- Read: Ezekiel 9:3a, 10:18-19, 11:22-23
- Check question: how does God's glory respond to his people worshipping other gods in his temple?
- This reverses the earlier descent of God's glory onto the tabernacle and Solomon's temple, and the rest of Ezekiel builds toward the return of God's glory to a rightly ordered sacred space.

## Dry Bones and Ascent Toward the Temple

- Read: Ezekiel 37:1, 11-14
- Reflection question: what have you noticed about the Spirit's role when people approach the mountain of God?
- The valley of dry bones shows Israel spiritually dead in exile, which the Bible warned was the inevitable outcome of long term idolatry and unfaithfulness (Deuteronomy 28:36–37).
- New life begins as God speaks and his Spirit breathes. God's word assembled the bones, and his Spirit breathes gives life. This is re-creation, an echo of passing through chaos waters into new life.
- Between this rebirth and a vision of ideal sacred space, an enemy is summoned and defeated.
- Read: Ezekiel 38:1-5, 39:5
- Gog comes from the line of Japheth, whose descendants settled in the far north, so Ezekiel presents him as the last northern invader in a long line of threats to God's people; he fits the recurring biblical pattern in which an enemy must be confronted at the boundary of sacred space, echoing the serpent and Egypt as the final obstacle removed before God's people may ascend into God's presence.

## The Temple Vision

- Read: Ezekiel 40:1
- Jubilee is the fifty year "release" when land returns to its true owner and debts are cancelled, and Ezekiel dates his vision to the tenth day of the new worship year, the Day of Atonement when the jubilee trumpet was blown, so that the twenty fifth year of exile stands as the midpoint of a fifty year cycle.
- Reflection question: why would God reveal a temple vision at the start of a new year marked by Jubilee overtones?
- Read: Ezekiel 40:2-4
- A radiant figure holding measuring tools meets Ezekiel. Like the guides in earlier visions, he escorts the prophet and commands him to observe carefully and report everything to the exiles. The meticulously ordered temple Ezekiel is about to be shown confronts the chaos of idolatry seen earlier in the book.
- This vision parallels Moses on Sinai. As Moses received the heavenly pattern for the tabernacle, Ezekiel now receives the heavenly pattern for restored worship.
- This vision prepares the way for Paul's teaching that God's people become the living temple. The plural "your" (*hymōn*) in 1 Corinthians 3:16–17 shows that the gathered community is God's dwelling place.

## Outer Wall, Gates, and Courts

- Read: Ezekiel 40:5a
- Reflection question: why is a wall needed if Gog, the final enemy, has been defeated?
- The outer wall exists to mark off sacred space and separate the holy from the unholy. Nothing associated with idolatry is permitted to cross this boundary.
- Read: Ezekiel 40:6, 14
- The massive east facing gatehouse functions as a guarded portal into holy space. Its uniquely towering supports, the first true vertical structure in the entire vision, make the boundary itself stand out and mark the initial upward movement into God's presence, reversing the eastward direction of exile and recalling Eden's, the tabernacle's, and the temple's eastern gates.
- Read: Ezekiel 40:28, 31
- The inner court has three gates, all facing inward toward the center where the altar stands. Their orientation draws the worshiper's attention to the place of sacrifice, the site where impurity is removed and worshipers are made fit to engage with God.
- While we won't read the passages, Ezekiel next highlights three dimensional sacrificial tables, where the burnt (ascension), sin, and guilt offerings are prepared for approach to God, along with nearby priestly rooms where they are to *shāmar*, "keep" the service of the temple, echoing humanity's original call to serve and keep the garden in Genesis 2:15.
- Read: Ezekiel 40:47
- The altar stands at the exact center of the inner court, in contrast to the literary center of Solomon's temple construction, which is the house of Pharaoh's daughter.

## The Temple

- Read: Ezekiel 40:48a, 49 (Septuagint)
- Next, the porch leading into the Holy Place is described. In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, it has ten steps, making a total of 25 steps: 10 here, 8 for the inner gates, and 7 for the outer gates.
- Read: Ezekiel 41:5, 15b-20
- Check question: what links to Eden are present in the temple in Ezekiel's vision?
- Side (*ṣēlāʿ* as sacred space architecture, first used for Adam's side), garden imagery, and cherubim link Eden, the tabernacle, Solomon's temple, and Ezekiel's temple, showing that assembled worship as the church, the new temple, is a return to Eden.
- Read: Ezekiel 41:21-22
- The ark and lampstand, symbols of God's presence and light, are absent, but the table, a symbol of God's provision and communion, remains as if anticipating the return of God's glory.
- Parts we cannot cover include the west building that blocks the chaos of the western sea and shows that entry comes only from the east through sacrifice, the three perfect squares of the temple complex that signal ordered holiness, and the priestly rooms where garments had to be changed before leaving the sanctuary; in Christ, believers are made holy and do not remove their clothing, for they remain clothed with Him even after leaving assembled worship (Galatians 3:27).

## The Return of Yahweh's Glory

- Read: Ezekiel 43:1-5
- Ezekiel sees the glory return from the east, the same direction from which it once departed; the entire eastern passage functions as one continuous ascent into God's presence.
- Read: Ezekiel 43:6-9
- God declares this temple his dwelling, correcting the failures of Israel's kings whose proximity and idolatry once polluted the sanctuary.
- Read: Ezekiel 43:10-12
- Reflection question: what does it mean for God to say that the temple's design should make Israel be convicted of their sin?
- The layout teaches the order of holiness, the entrances teach who may draw near and how, and the sacrifices and worship festivals described later teach the way of approach and the rhythm of worship that shapes Israel's life around God.
- In assembled worship, this vision finds its fulfillment in Christ, the One through whom God's glory returns to dwell with His people.
- God's people behold His holiness, turn from their sin, and are reshaped by His presence so that His life extends outward through them in ordered, life giving ways.

## The Altar

- Read: Ezekiel 43:13-17
- The altar, also described in three dimensions, has tiers like a stepped mountain. The word for the "hearth" sound like "God's mountain" in Hebrew, signaling that the ascent that began at the outer gate reaches its summit here.
- Recall that all the gates of the inner court faces the altar. In assembled worship, the church ascends Mount Zion, gathering around Christ's forever sacrifice, being cleansed and renewed in His presence.
- Ezekiel next briefly surveys the remaining features of the temple—the closed east gate, the priestly rules, the central strip, the weights and measures, the festivals, the prince's portion (the prince representing an ideal, humble king), and the temple kitchens—all of which reinforce ordered holiness and prepare for the final movement where life flows outward from God's presence.

## The River and the City

- Read: Ezekiel 47:1a, 3-7, 12b
- Ezekiel is brought back to the temple entrance, where water begins as a trickle beneath the threshold and deepens as it flows east. Life flows outward from God's presence, as in Eden.
- As God's new temple, the church becomes the agent through which this life spreads into a world marked by death. From our worship should flow life.
- After describing a just distribution of land to a renewed Israel, Ezekiel's vision ends with the description of a city.
- Read: Ezekiel 48:30-35
- Ezekiel concludes his vision with the description of a city set south of the sanctuary. Its gates bear the names of Israel's tribes, signaling that the whole people have been gathered and restored.
- *Yahweh šāmmâ* means "Yahweh is over there," indicating that the city is not God's dwelling but a waypoint for pilgrims who look upward toward the sanctuary where His presence truly rests.
- In assembled Christian worship, this becomes a weekly confession that while God is "over there" when His people are scattered in the world, He is "here" when they gather as His Spirit filled temple, the place where heaven and earth meet.

## Conclusion

- In gathered worship, God meets His people, restores them, and makes them His dwelling place.
- From that encounter, His life flows outward through us into a world marked by death.
- When we worship, Yahweh is here, and we look forward to the day when the union of heaven and earth is permanent and eternal.
