The tabernacle stands as God's dwelling among His people, a portable Sinai where heaven and earth meet. Exodus 25–40 traces the movement from divine blueprint to earthly construction, from the golden calf rupture to covenant renewal, culminating in the Glory of the Lord filling the completed sanctuary and radiating blessing to Israel.

## Summary

In this lesson, we explore how the tabernacle functions as new creation, heavenly reality made visible, and the place where God reorients Israel's identity. The instructions mirror Genesis 1 in their sevenfold structure, the Spirit fills Bezalel as He once hovered over the waters, and the sanctuary's design reflects the cosmos itself. The golden calf interrupts this ascent, threatening Israel's relationship with God, yet Moses intercedes and the covenant is renewed by grace. Through the Day of Atonement, God provides ongoing cleansing for both people and sanctuary. The priests, clothed in garments that map sacred space, minister at the threshold between common and holy ground. The pattern reaches its completion in the Aaronic blessing, where God's shining face extends from the sanctuary to the people. This movement from presence to blessing anticipates Christ, the true high priest who brings the church into the heavenly Mount Zion for renewal and blessing.
